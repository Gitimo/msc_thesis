\section{Introduction}

In this section, I will outline the steps taken to achieve reliable surface photo voltage (\spv{}) measurements as a function of temperature.\\
In the Cahen group, three Kelvin Probes (\kp{}s) are in use. One measures in ambient, in a humidity controlled room (20\% relative humidity), one in a controlled nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box (ideally $<5ppm \,O_2 $ \& $ H_2O$ ). Those two are in-house built and use probe-heads manufactured by Besoke. The last one, situated inside a Lakeshore cryogenic system, is built by \McA{} and can measure in ambient under argon atmosphere \& in vacuum, with temperature dependence. It originally uses a probe head provided by \McA{} but was complemented by in-house designed probe-heads to allow for \spv{}-measurements. \\
A standard reference with known and stable work-function, \hopg{}, is used to calibrate the probe, \ie{} to find the work function of the probe head. To compare \cpd{}-measurements of the three probes,  \sih{} was used as a relatively stable and well understood sample. To compare \spv{}-measurements, aluminium was deposited onto \sih{} by atomic layer deposition (ALD), resulting in an alumina-coated samples. These were measured in ambient and in the \McA{}. Vanadium-oxide samples were used as a proof of concept for the measurements of the surface-photo voltage as a function of temperature.
\subsection{(Brief-)Theory}
When two (semi-)conductors with dissimilar fermi-levels are electrically connceted from their back-side with a gap between them, charge will flow from the material with the lower work function (\wf{}) to the one with the higher \wf{}~\footnote{The work function is defined as the energy needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point in vacuum immediately outside of it}. Electrons will stop flowing when equilibrium is established. As long as there is a gap between the materials, an electrical field will develop in the gap due to the difference in the local vacuum level across this gap. 
The potential drop across the gap is known as the contact potential difference or \cpd{}. When the work functions are expressed in Electron-Volts, the \cpd{} is directly equal to the difference of the \wf{}s:
\begin{equation}
\label{wf}
	|{\cpd}| \, = \, | \wfp \, - \wfs | \, .
\end{equation}
Here, the equation is expressed in terms of absolute value because the sign of the \cpd{} is ultimately dependent on how the measurement system, the Kelvin Probe, is set up. The materials then behave as a parallel plate capacitor, where the potential drops over the space between the two samples. In such a capacitor, the potential drop is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{cap}
	V \, = \,  \frac{Q}{C(d)} \, , 
\end{equation}
where $C(d)$, the capacitance, is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates $d$, $Q$ is the charge on the surfaces and $V$ is the potential set by the difference in local vacuum levels.\\
The \cpd{} is measured by mechanically vibrating the probe-head, thus periodically changing the size of the gap. This causes the capacitance to change as well and according to Equation \eqref{cap}, charge will again flow from one material to the other resulting in a steady state alternating current. This AC current is nulled by an external current source with known impedance from which the equivalent DC voltage needed to null the current can be calculated. This voltage is equal and opposite to the \cpd{}. Thus, if \wfp{} is known, \wfs{} can easily be calculated from Equation \eqref{wf}.\\
The work function of a semiconductor (with molecular surface modification) is composed of the electron affinity $\upchi$~\footnote{The difference between the vacuum-level and the bottom of the conduction band}, plus the position of the Fermi level in the semiconductor band-gap, $\upzeta$, and a surface-charge dependent band-bending term $BB$. $\upzeta$ in turn is dependent on the doping level of the semiconductor and is approximately given by:\\
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}
	\begin{equation}
	E_{f,n} \, =  E_i \, - \, kT \ln{\frac{n}{n_i}}
	\end{equation}
\end{minipage}	
\hfill
and
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}
	\begin{equation}
	E_{f,p} \, = E_i \, + \, kT \ln{\frac{p}{p_i}}
	\end{equation}
\end{minipage},\\
for n- and p-type semiconductors respectively. The difference in \cpd{} between the illuminated and the dark condition is called the surface photovoltage or \spv{}. For n-type semiconductors, the \spv{} is negative, for p-type it\rq{}s positive. It is, however, common to report absolute values of \spv{}.\\
The surface of a crystal can essentially be seen as one large defect in that crystal. After all, a crystal is, amongst others, defined by translational symmetry of its unit cell. This translational symmetry is necessarily broken at the surface. Next to this very basic phenomenon, other types of imperfections will also be found at the surface. These imperfections can be further crystal defects such as kinks or terraces, as well as incorporation of impurities in the form of foreign atoms. In semiconductors, this can lead to a depletion region, in which minority carriers are moved away from the surface by a built-in electrical field.  Illuminating a semiconductor will lead to photogeneration of electron-hole pairs within the bulk of the semiconductor. From there, the minority carriers can diffuse to the surface where they may replenish depleted carriers, change the surface charge and affect the band-bending, $BB$. Thus, illuminating the semiconductor can change its work-function and this change in \wf{} is measured as the surface photovoltage. As already stated, the aim of this project was to use reliable and well understood samples to develop a method to reliably measure the \spv{} as a function of temperature. Such a method is of interest to research in the solid-state, as it can reveal insights into the fine band-structure of a semiconductor. In particular, trap-states may be present within the band-gap due to imperfections already mentioned above (dangling bonds, impurities etc.). Lowering the temperature may affect the thermal distribution of carriers sufficiently to freeze-out these traps. In such a condition, one would assume that photogenerated carriers might repopulate such traps and one would therefore assume to see a corresponding change in the measured surface photovoltage.  From here, it is easy to see why lowering the temperature of a sample may have further advantages for the measurement of the \spv{}. \spv{} is affected by photogenerated carriers, i.e. by carriers undergoing band-to-band transitions. If one reduces the concentration of thermally generated free carriers, photogenerated carriers will have a more pronounced influence on the overall electrical structure of the material. KRONIK\\
One of the most typical applications of \spv{} measurements is determining, or rather trying to determine, the band-banding by photosaturating the semiconductor sample. Under conditions of photo-saturation, the concentration of generated carriers becomes so large as as to nullify the surface charge, in effect flatting the band throughout the semiconductor. For this, it is crucial to achieve sufficient illumination intensities.

\section{Kelvin Probes in use}
\subsection{The Lakeshore Cryogenic System coupled with a Macallister Kelvin Probe}
Lakeshore is an international vendor of cryogenic probe stations. For this research, a Lakeshore Model TTPX Probe Station was used. The prope station can be thought of as being divided into four components. An outer vacuum-chamber is connected to a pump to reduce the pressure inside the station. An Argon gas inlet connected to the vacuum chamber can be used to provide an inert atmosphere. Inside the vacuum chamber is a separate, smaller chamber: the radiation shielding stage, primarily used to shield the sample from infrared radiation and thus used to facilitate measurements at low temperatures. The radiation shielding to some extend also provides electrical shielding from stray electrical signals and can therefore act as a quasi Faraday-cage. Both these chambers are fitted with windows to allow for placement of the probe-arms and to allow for visual inspection of the experiment. The radiation shielding stage's windows is made from sapphire glass, as sapphire glass is oblique to infrared radiation. Inside the shielding stage is placed the sample stage, which allows for mounting of samples and can provide an electrical "ground". The fourth and last component of the probe station are its six probe-arms. They allow for placement of several probes on the sample from the outside. For many measurements, these probes are conceptually simple gold wires which allow for electrical measurements of the sample, such as IV and CV characterisation. Being a cryogenic system, the Lakeshore is fitted with three thermocouples. They measure the temperature of the sample stage, the radiation chamber and the probe-arm respectively. The temperature is adjusted by an electrical heater and by controling the flow of of coolant, either liquid nitogen or -- to achieve lower temperatures -- liquid helium. In our case, one of the probe arms is fitted with a modified Macallister Ultra-High-Vacuum Kelvin Probe Head. The original Macallister UHV Kelvin probe head is a horizontal base-arm ending in a vibrating, stainless steel cylinder of 2.6mm diameter ending in a continuous, flat disk. This disk forms one of the two capacitor plates necessary for a \cpd{} measurement. The other capacitor is, of course, the sample. In the Macallister, the measured signal is given by
\begin{equation}
	{\cpd} \, = \,  \wfp \, - \wfs  \, ,
\end{equation}
i.e. the signal is equal to the work function of the probe head, usually $\approx 4.5 eV$, minus the work function of the sample. A reduction in measured \cpd{} therefore means an increase in the sample's work function.\\
The original probe head configuration is not suitable for the Lakeshore cryogenic system because the sample needs to be placed horizontally onto the sample-stage. Therefore, a vertical geometry is needed for the probe-head. Such a custom system was provided by Macallister. The stainless-steel Kelvin probe head is now vertically mounted in a plastic base. The size and especially the weight-distribution of the original cylinder are carefully designed by Macallister to comply with a vibration-response that is suitable for the probe head controler. The probe head is electrically connected by a gold wire that runs along the base-arm and is either soldered directly onto the cylinder or tightly wrapped around a conductive screw which is used to hold the probe head in place in its plastic holder. In the latter case, conductive silver paste suitable for UHV environments is applied to the screw to ensure low resistance electrical connection. Contact potential difference measurements are severely negatively affected by non-ohmic back contacts. A second probe arm of the cryogenic system was fitted with an optical fibre to allow for laser illumination of the sample. However, in practice, it quickly became clear that such an illumination setup was unsuitable for \spv{} measurements. This was due to several reasons. For suitable \cpd{} measurements, the probe head needs to be brought in very close proximity to the sample: distances on the scale of a few hundred micrometers are often necessary to obtain a sufficiently noise-free signal~\footnote{This adds to the practical danger of involuntarily crashing the vibrating probe head onto the sample, potentially damaging the sample, contaminating the probe head and generally interfering with conducting an experiment}. Therefore, there is simply not enough room for the exit of the optical fiber to be placed in a position where light would illuminate the sample. A further difficulty of the fiber illumination scheme are noticeable reductions in light intensity due to absorption in the fiber. After all, the fiber needs to be able withstand vaccum conditions and low temperatures, limiting the choice of suitable materials. Lastly, the fiber would provide a very localised spot of illumination. For a successfull measurement of the \spv{}, the whole area under the probe head has to be saturated by illumination at the very least. Full saturation of the whole sample surface is in most cases desirable to suppress unwanted carrier recombination in the dark areas. For these reasons, it was decided to modify the probe head and employ a different illumination scheme. The cryogenic system's windows allow for illumination by a source of light placed outside the vacuum chamber, on top of the external window, focused onto the sample surface. To allow this scheme to work, the main body of the probe head needed to be hollowed out and holes needed to be drilled into the head's disk to let light pass through and onto the sample. Such a probe head, manufactured from stainless steel, was provided by Macallister and used in initial experiments. When successfull measurements were not forthcoming, three further modifications of the probe head were tried, all based on the same principle. The idea was to replace the massive disk with a wire-grid used for transmission electron microscopy. Three different types of wire-grids were purchased from ???. A stiff, stainless steel grid with XX\% opacity, two thin, flexible gold grids with XX and XX\% opacity respectively. The grids were laser-welded onto custom-made, hollowed out stainless steel cylinders. These new probe heads were manufactured by the Weizmann Institute's Department for Construction and Engineering. Care was taken to ensure acoustic vibration characteristics of the new probe heads were similar, if not identical to those of Macallister's original probe heads. The wire-grids would add two benefits: they would increase the overall transmission of the probe head as well as allow for a more even illumination of the sample surface. In practice, however, no immediate, significant difference between the performance of the original hollow stainless steel probe head and the new, TEM wire-grid heads was found. At this point, an inherent limitation of the adopted illumination scheme has to be pointed out: namely that even in the ideal case, illumination from above will only result in an illuminated area directly under the probe head. The probe arm, probe head holder and even the edge of the hollow cylinder will all cast a a shadow on the sample, especially since they need to be placed directly above it.\\
In order to allow for saturating illumination of the sample, the choice of light source is crucial and it was thus a main focus of this part of the project to identify such a source and to successfully connect it to the combination of Lakeshore cryogenic station and Macallister Kelvin Probe. Successful \spv{} measurements are routinely carried out in the group using the ambient Kelvin Probe. This probe uses a xenon-lamp driven by a VariAC-power source with up to 60W electrical power. The xenon-lamp is not only a source of light, but also a source of heat and thus unsuitable for the temperature-dependent measurement inside the \McA{}. Not only would the heat introduce uncertainties in temperature but temperature gradients introduced by it could also damage the cryostation, specifically the radiation shielding stage's sapphire window. Therefore, the coice fell upon a high intensity, natural-white light LED by manufactured by LEDEngin. The LEDEngin LED uses 25 LED-spots soldered onto and electrically connected by a PCB. Using thermo-paste, the LED is mounted onto a copper-core of a discarded PC-fan. The fan-motor is driven by a small 12V AC current source to achieve the necessary cooling of the delicate LED. As purchased, the LED has a relatively wide illumination cone of 60$^{\circ}$, due to an internal fish-eye lens that is situated right atop the PCB. Therefore, the lamp was supplemented by a total internal relection lens by LEDEngin that focuses 90\% of the illumination into a 10$^{\circ}$ wide cone. The initial LED of nominally 4200$lm$ intensity was damaged, only 12 of 25 LED-spots were functioning and was later replaced by new LED of the same manufacturer with 5200 $lm$ intensity. The LED is driven by a variable DC source at a maximum voltage of 18.2 $V$ and maximum current of 1.5 $A$.


\section{Comparison of Systems for measuring room temperature \cpd{}}
\subsection{Sample Preparation}
A fresh \hopg{}-surface is prepared by gently rubbing adhesive tape onto a square piece of \hopg{} and tearing it off evenly. The piece is mounted onto a sample-holder using an electrically cunductive clip and the \cpd{} is measured.\\
n-\sih{} (100) with different resitivities/doping-levels is prepared according to a slightly modified standard cleaning procedure: pieces of suitable size are cut with a diomand tip cutter, swiped off with ethyl-acetate and successively sonicated for three minutes each in ethyl-acetate, acetone, methanol and water. The pieces are microwave-treated in an $O_2$-plasma at 100W with a flow of 1\litmin O$_2$ and 1.5\litmin Ar for 3 minutes. Subsequently, samples are rinsed with pure water (18$M\Omega \, cm$ at 20 $^{\circ}C$), immersed in 2\% HF etching solution for 1 minute, rinsed with water and ashered again as before. The pieces are etched as before, back-contacts are created by applying InGa-eutectic to a scratched back surface. The piece is mounted onto a sample holder and the \cpd{} is measured for at least two minutes each on three different spots per piece. The time the sample is subjected to ambient after etch and before each measurment is recorded and used in a linear fit \lq{}$\Delta (\cpd{})/\Delta \, t$\rq{} to find the -- arguably somewhat hypothetical -- \cpd{} each spot on each piece would have had right after the etch, i.e. without the time needed for creating the back surface and mounting the sample.\\
p-\sih{}(100) is prepared as n-\sih{}, but the 2\% HF-etch is replaced by a three minutes etch in 5\% buffered-oxide-etch (BOE), a solution of 10:1 by volume NH$_4$F:HF.\\
\subsection{Results & Discussion}
The standard deviation of measured \cpd{} between spots of the same piece is comparable to that between pieces, so all obtained values were averaged. The values obtained across the three systems agree very well with each other and in the case of mid- and high-resistivity silicon also with theory, see Figure \ref{fig:nsih}. A three,  instead of only one, minute long HF etch did not influence the \cpd{} obtained for the low resistivity sample. A possible explanation for the deviation from theory might be that the method fails because the surface-reactivity of silicon increases with doping-level. Thus for highly-doped silicon, the linear extrapolation to the point right after etch is more \lq{}hypothetical\rq{} than for the other two conditions.

\section{\cpd{} as function of pressure and temperature}
Once it was established that results obtained from the three independent system under similar conditions using hydrogenated silicon as a reference sample, efforts were concentrated on temperature and pressure dependent emasurements in the Lakeshore cryogenic system. Because of unavoidable contamination with oxygen from ambient, hydrogenated silicon was not used to that end. Instead, a freshly prepared reference of \hopg{} was placed on the ground of the radiation shielding stage without a sample-mount. An electrically conductive screw and clip were used to connect the top of the \hopg{} sample to the electrical ground of the Lakeshore. Two sets of experiments were carried out to independently determine the influence of pressure and temperature on the measured \cpd{}. In the first set, the measurements was commenced under ambient condition and allowed to continue for some time. The probe head was then retracted to avoid crashing it onto the sample and the weak pump was turned on. The probe head was then brought into proximity of the sample to continue the measurement and the measurement was allowed to continue for some time. The probe head was retracted again and the turbo pump was switched on. Again, the probe head was lowered to continue with the measurement and the measurement was allowed to continue for some time. For results of this experiment, see Figure \ref{fig:hopg-p}.

This experiment revealed several features. Firstly, the \cpd{} of \hopg{} rises as a function of time under ambient condition. This is readily explained by oxigenation and/or other sources of contamination from ambient, such as water for example. Once the weak pump is turned on, there is a discontinuiety in \cpd{}. This dicontinoutity is not systematic in its direction, it may change the \cpd{} either 'up' or 'down' and can therefore best be explained by a displacement of the probe head over the sample. The sudden reduction in pressure exerts a force on the probe arm and may cause it to move slightly. The size of the discontinuity is within the size of variation of \cpd{} observed when different spots of the same reference are measured. The \cpd{} now reduces as a function of time and this may be explained by gradual decontamination of the sample: as the pressure reduces, previsouly adsorbed contaminants may leave the surface. A second viable explanation may be a gradual change in acoustic vibration characteristics as a result of the reduction in pressure. To distinguish between the two, an experiment was performed in which the sample chamber was flushed with clean, inert Argon after having been subjected UHV conditions for about 20 minutes. It is assumed that complete desorbtion of possible contaminants is achieved by this treatment and that the high purity argon does not introduce fresh contaminats. The pressure was then again reduced using the weak pump and the \cpd{} again reduces as a function of time. We therefore conclude that the observed reduction in \cpd{} is indeed caused by gradual changes in pressure rather than desorption of contaminants. It is thus advisable to carry out \cpd{} experiments under conditions of stable pressure, especially given the fact that the probe head is specifically designed by Macallister to carry out ultra-high vacuum \cpd{} measurements. To summarise: \cpd{} measurements using the Lakeshore are feasible when the pressure is constant. They may be carried out under ambient pressure with an inert argon atmosphere or under ultra-high vacuum conditions. A changing pressure is not conducive for reliable measurements of the contact potential difference.\\
To determine the possible influence of temperature on the quality and reliablility of the measurement, an ultra-thin layer of aluminium was deposited onto a piece of silicon by atomic-layer-deposition and a natural layer of surface oxide was formed. Alumina was chosen as a surface of interest because of its natural affinity for water. If contamination by water and subsequent freezing of the surface is an inherent problem of low temperature \cpd{} measurements, then a strongly hydrophilic surface should exhibit these problems. A fresh wafer of silicon with 20 nm of aluminium by ALD was cut into suitable pieces. Pieces were swiped off with ethyl-acetat and sonicated for three minutes in iso-propanol, blow-dried under N$_2$ and subsequently microwave-treated in an $O_2$-plasma at 100W with a flow of 1\litmin O$_2$ and 1.5\litmin Ar for 3 minutes, ensuring a clean alumina surface. The back-side was scratched and InGa-eutectic was applied to create a back-contact. The work-function of this surface was measured in the ambient probe station and found to be 4.0 $\pm$ 0.12 eV. To ensure an ohmic back-contact, the sample stage of the Lakeshore was lightly scratched and a small quantity of InGa-eutectic was applied to the stage. The piece was then placed on the sample stage and slight pressure was applied. The stage was introduced into the Lakeshore cryogenic system and the pressure was reduced. Using liquid nitrogen and the heaters, the temperature was reduced to 250K and allowed to stabilise. Under these conditions, the work-function of the alumina surface was found to be 4.17$\pm$ 0.15 eV~\footnote{A suitable piece of \hopg{} was also present in the sample chamber to allow for calibration of the work-function of the probe head}. We therefore conclude that lowering the temperature below the freezing point of water does not pose an inherent restriction on the feasibility of \cpd{} measurements in the Lakeshore system. It has to be pointed out that the sample surface is not the coldest point inside the Lakeshore's inner chamber. Because of the way liquid nitrogen is introduced into the system, the radiation chamber's ground surface is the coldest. Therefore, it can be assumed that any ice would form there rather than on the sample, corroborating the result presented above.


\section{Measuring the \spv{} at room temperature}
A necessary condition for the successful determination of the \spv{} of a sample is saturation with light. In practice, this means that the light-intensity during a measurement of the \spv{} is gradually increased up to the point where further increase in intensity does not lead to further increase of the measured surface photo voltage. Detailed interpretation of the measured signal is often problematic and requires intimate knowledge of the sample and even theoretical discussions of the \spv{} tend to be very involved. However, from the point of view of establishing whether a new experimental set-up is suitable for more advanced \spv{}-measurements, a successful, saturated measurement of the \spv{} of a relatively simple test-sample is a necessary precondition. To that end, \spv{} measurements of an alumina surface were chosen as a test case. Alumina was chosen for its stbility, relative simplicity and because of its relatively large \spv{} signal. The sample is the same as used for the determination of the temperature dependence of the \cpd{}: 20 nm aluminium deposited by ALD onto a wafer of silicon. The preparation and cleaning protocol of the sample is the same as above: rinsing; sonication; oxidation and creation of an ohmic back-contact using InGa-eutectic. The sample's \spv{} was determined in the ambient probe station as is~\footnote{i.e. ambient probe station and xenon light source} and was found to be 530 pm 20 mV. To check if the LED is a suitable source, it was installed in the ambient probe station and an \spv{} measurement was carried out. To facilitate the comparison between the systems, the ambient probe station's light focusing lens was removed as no such lens could readily be installed with the Lakeshore. Since the LED has a variable electrical source, it was possible to increase the current through the LED from 0 to 1 A in steps of 0.1 A. The sample was then introduced into the Lakeshore's inner chamber and the LED was placed on top of the vacuum chamber's outer window. The current through the LED was increased in the same steps as for the measurement in ambient and the results of the experiment are summarised in Figure \ref{fig:Iseries}. In that Figure 'Upstairs' refers to the measurement in the ambient probe station, 'Downstairs' refers to the measurement with the Macallister probe head, 'old' refers to the initial LED with only 12 of 25 spots working and 'new' refers to the newly purchased LED in which all diodes are working and which achieves a maximum illumination of 5200 lm. It has to be pointed out that the new LED could be driven further than up to a maximum of 1.0 A to reach its full illumination intensity at a maximum current of 1.6 A, so the experiment was extended to make use of the maximum achievable intensity. As can be seen, saturation of the \spv{} is readily achieved with the LED in ambient at a current of 0.6 A and the measured value of 540 pm 10 mV is in good agreement with the value expected from the measurement of the \spv{} with a xenon light source. It is furthermore aparent that the measurement achieves saturation. At a current of about 0.8 A, a further increase in current does not result in a corresponding significant increase in measured surface photo voltage. However, there is a significant discrepancy of 60 mV~\footnote{about 10\% of the maximum signal} in measured \spv{} between the two systems which cannot readily be explained. A similar experiment using neutral density filters to control the light intensity was carried out, but no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from the results, so it is not presented here. In a following step, the \spv{} of the alumina sample was measured with the Lakeshore not completely assembled. The vacuum chamber's lid as well as the radiations shielding chamber's lid were removed and the LED was held by hand as close to the probe head as possible without interfering with the measurement~\footnote{a constant stream of argon was employed to avoid undue contamination of the inner chamber from ambient.}. This configuration obviously does not represent a working condition for the Lakeshore, nor is it readily reproducible because of its vague parameters, but an \spv{} of XXX could be achieved in this way. At this point, the nature of the 60 mV discrepancy remains unknown. It might be due to the increased distance between the source and the sample or it might be due to partial absorption by the Lakeshore's windows, especially the IR-shielding sapphire glass but the results obtained here remain hard to interpret properly. Saturation is achieved, but not at the right level. Simply using a stronger source will therefore most likely not alleviate the problem. It may be tried to replace the windows by lenses which better focus the lightbeam onto the sample but is is questionable if such a scheme is practically feasible or indeed even helpful. Practically, such window-lenses would have to be able to withstand UHV conditions and saturation was achieved in ambient even without a lens, where the distance between sample and source is comparable to the corresponding distance in the cryogenic system. Since no explanations of the source of the discrepancy between the systems are forthcoming, a systematic experimental uncertainty of underestimating the \spv{} by about 10\% has to be assumed when using the Lakeshore in conjunction with the LED.


\section{Temperature dependent measurement of the \spv{}}
Since it was established that temperature dependent \cpd{} measurements could realiably be carried out and that, albeit with a systematic uncertainty, \spv{} measurements could also be carried out with the Lakeshore cryogenic system, the final step was to attempt a combined experiment and carry out a temperature dependent measurement of the surface photo voltage. To this end, a suitable sample needed to be identified. This sample should have a sufficiently large photo-response and should undergo some phase transition at a well defined, critical temperature. Three different systems were investigated: biological samples consisting of a plant's photo-system immobilized on a gold surface; a lead-iodide-chloride perovskite on titanium-dioxide and finally a thin layer of vanadium oxide.\\
The biological samples exhibited changes in \cpd{} on the order of 20 mV. These changes occured at a well defined temperature, between 250 and 260 K. While interesting, these changes but were too small to serve as a reliable system for a proof of principle: 20 mV is within the experimental uncertainty of both the \cpd{} and the \spv{} measurements The biological samples were therefore quickly abandoned.\\
For the perovskites, it was attempted to compare their reaction when exposed to different parts of the optical spectrum, namely to compare their dark \cpd{} to the \cpd{} when exposed to full spectrum illumination and when exclusively exposed to infra-red illumination. The perovskite sample was introduced to the inner chamber of the Lakeshore and electrically contacted with the help of a conductive clip and screw. To allow for electrical connection via the back contact, the perovskite was removed from the point where the clip contacted the sample. The cryogenic system was evacuated and seven temperatures where chosen at which to measure the \cpd{}: 130, 170, 210, 230, 250, 270 \& 280 K. At each of these temperatures, the dark \cpd{} was measured. A filter which would only allow IR radiation to pass was placed in front of the source, the sample was briefly illuminated and the IR \cpd{} was measured. The \cpd{} of the system was allowed to decay back to its original dark value and the filter was removed. The system was then briefly illuminated by full spectrum at high intensity and the light \cpd{} was measured. The \cpd{} of the system was allowed to decay back to its original dark-value and the system was then cooled down to the next temperature step. In the course of this measurement, repositioning the probe head to new positions over the sample was necessary because although care was taken, crashing the probe head onto the sample could not be avoided. The whole experiment was carried out under low pressure conditions, but for the lowest five temperature points, the pressure was about a factor ten lower than for the measurements taken at 270 \& 280 K. For the sake of completeness, the results of this measurement are shown in Figure \ref{fig:perovskitecpd} and briefly summarised here. The light \cpd{} is stable to within $\approx$ 100 mV. The difference between dark and light \cpd{}, i.e. the light \spv{} ranges from approximately 200 to approximately 350 mV. The IR \cpd{} varies over a range of about 300 mV and the IR \spv{} varies both in magnitude as well as direction: from approximately 80 to about -220 mV. None of these parameters show a clear dependence on temperature in their variation. To carry out the experiment, the set up of the Macallister had to be modified twofold. Measurements had to be carried out without the inner chamber's sapphire glass window as this would exclude any infra-red radiation from reaching the samples in the first place. Secondly, the xenon lamp had to be used as a source of illumination to give access to the infra-red part of the spectrum. These modifications introduced experimental difficulties for seevral reasons. As already pointed out, the xenon lamp is a source of heat and therefore, an unknown experimental uncertainty in the temperature was introduced. The experiment had to be carried out very quickly to avoid damage to the system and to minimize said uncertainty in temperature. In effect, only a brief flash of illumination could be allowed to reach the sample. Furthermore, the xenon lamp and its high power electrical source had to be set up in close proximity to the Lakeshore cryogenic system and electrical noise due to the relatively high currents and voltages involved in this experiment were introduced. To add to these problems, the sample was neither fresh nor necessarily stable and perovskites are inherently complicated systems so it was decided that this experiment could not serve for the purpose of showing a reliable \spv{}(T) measurement.\\

\subsection{Vanadium oxide}
\subsubsection{Discription of samples and preliminary research carried out at the Cahen group}
Vanadium-diooxide ($VO_2$) is a system well known for undergoing a metal to insulator transition (\emph{MIT}) close to room temperature. At the heart of this transition lies a reconfiguration of the of the crystal lattice, where $VO_2$ transitions from its high-temperature tetragonal (rutile) phase to a low temperature monoclinic phase. In the tetragonal phase, the Fermi level of the material is well within the conduction band and hence, the material behaves like a metal. In the monoclinic phase, an energy gap has developed and the material now behaves like an insulator. REF NAKANO NATURE. Of course, the only difference between an insulator and a semiconductor is the size of their energy gaps and if the transition occurs gradually, one might also speak of a metal-semiconductor-insulator transition instead of an \emph{MIT}. This transitions has extensively been studied using different methods. Noteworthy are X-Ray diffraction studies REF, but because of their relative simplicity, studies of the resistivity of the material stick out REF. In these, changes of resistivity over several orders of magnitude are not uncommon. REF. Finally, the MIT in $VO_2$ was also investigated using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy, where $\sim$200 nm thin stripes of the material were grown adjecent to a stripe of gold ($Au$). These strips were continuously scanned over a temperature range including the phase transition temperature ($T_{MI}$) of $VO_2$. $Au$ provided a stable reference work function and thus, the work function of $VO_2$ could be measured in aboslute terms. It was found that vanadium-dioxide has a workfunction of $\sim$ 5.15 eV in its metallic phase and that the workfunction gradually decreased by $\sim$ 0.15 eV over a range of 60 K. In other studies REF SHIBUYA, it was found that \emph{MIT} could be tuned by tungsten-doping of a thin film of $VO_2$ grown on a supporting matrix of $TiO_2$ and preliminary research into similar samples has already been carried out in the Cahen group.
The samples were either pure or 2\% tungsten-doped vanadium-dioxide of thicknesses ranging from 10 to 80 nm grown on either $TiO_2$ or on niobium-doped titanium-dioxide ($Nb:TiO_2$) and were kindly provided by M. Nakano of RKIEN. A change in resistivity of several orders of magnitude upon \emph{MIT} could be shown for these samples. When used for this project, however, the collection of vanadium-dioxide samples had already been in storage inside a dessicator for more than a year. Many samples were damaged and proper storage throughout the year could not be guaranteed. Therefore, the choice of sample for this project was limited to pieces which, upon optical inspection, were closest to their initial appearance and were still large enough to allow proper positioning of the probe head over a sufficiently homogeneous surface. Therefore, a sample of 50 nm 2\% $W:VO_2$ on pure $TiO_2$ was chosen. It had been investigated by Nir Kedem using the van der Pauw method with a temperature resolution $<$5 K. It showed an approximately two orders of magnitude change in resitivity with a relatively gradual profile, occuring over the temperature range from 220 to 270K. The resistivity also exhibited hysteresis, with up to half an order of magnitude difference in resitivity between cooling down and heating up.
\subsubsection{Experimental procedure, results and discussion}
Initially, the work function of the vanadium-dioxide sample was determined with the ambient probe station. The sample was sonicated for three minutes each in aceton, ethanol and THF and was then blow-dried under $N_2$. To callibrate the probe head, a fresh surface of \hopg{} was prepared and the \cpd{} was measured. The work function of the probe head was found to be 5.085 $pm$ 15 eV. The work function of the clean $W:VO_2$ sample was determined to be 5.17 $pm$ 20 eV, in remarkable agreement with the value obtained by Ko et al. REF KO\\
Before each measurement, the sample was subjected to the same cleaning procedure outlined above. The sample was then blow-dried under $N_2$ and placed directly on the ground of the inner chamber of the Lakeshore. Electrical contact was made from the top using a conductive screw and clip. The Lakeshore was then evacuated and the experiment commenced once a stable vacuum condition was obtained.\\
In the first experiment, the Lakeshore was cooled down to the lowest temperature achievable by liquid nitrogen cooling: 97 K for this cryogenic system. During this cool-down, the \cpd{} was quickly measured at three points where the temperature remained relatively stable for a sufficient time. Once the lowest possible temperature was reached, the flow of nitrogen was stopped, the heater was set to 300 K and the \cpd{} was measured continuously. This protocol allows for a quick measurement of the \cpd{}(T)-response of the system to identify the temperature range of interest, but uncertainties in temperature are introduced because of the temperature gradient present in the inner chamber and because of having to note down the temperature manually. The experiment had to be aborted. The data obtained during this initial experiment are shown in Figure \ref{fig:vox1}.\\
For the next experiment, the temperature range was extended and more care was taken to more accurately determine the temperature. The system was cooled down to 100 K and gradually increased. The \cpd{} was measured at 11 well defined temperatures. For each of these temperatures, the flow of liquid nitrogen and the heater setting were carefully adjusted until all three of the cryogenic system's temperature read-outs were within a range of 5 K of each other. Holding the temperature constant, the \cpd{} was then recorded once every second for a period of 100 seconds and these data were averaged. The temperature was increased to the next set-point and the procedure was repeated. The observations of this experiment are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:vox2}. The uncertainty in \cpd{} was taken to be twice the standard deviation of \cpd{} values obtained during the 100 second period. Uncertainty in temperature is not shown but assumed to be less than 5 K.\\
In the last experiment, both dark and light \cpd{} were measured for the same sample for a range of temperatures between 180 and 300 K in intervals of 20 K. \cpd{} was only measured once the temperature gradient inside the Lakeshore was less than 5 K. For each temperature, dark \cpd{} was measured once every second over a period of 100 seconds and these data were averaged. Illumination for light \cpd{} was achieved by the LED at maximum intensity and to avoid possibly heating the sample, light \cpd{} was measured for 15 seconds. \hopg{} as a reference for the work function was not used in this experiment. Instead, the work function of the sample at 300 K in vacuum was assumed to be the same as that obtained from the same sample at room temperature in ambient and the work function of the probe could therefore be calculated to be 4.41 eV. The results of this final experiment are shown in Figure \ref{fig:vox3}. The experimental uncertainty in work function includes twice the standard deviation of dark \cpd{} obtained during the 100 second interval plus an added uncertainty from the calculation of the work function of the probe head. The experimental uncertainty in \spv{} includes uncertainty from dark \cpd{} as well as that for light \cpd{}. Uncertainty in temperature is, again, not shown, but assumed less than 5 K.\\
Probably the most remarkable feature of these measuremnts is the sudden drop in \cpd{} (sudden rise in \wf{}) at $\sim$ 120 K and the consequent sudden rise in \cpd{} around $\sim$ 170 K seen in both Figure \ref{fig:vox1} and Figure \ref{fig:vox2}. Since these features were observed during cool down as well as during heating up in the first and were again observed in the second, independent measurement, they are most likely not an artifact of the measurement, nor should they be ascribed to simple experimental failure. They represent a change in work function of $\sim$ 200 to $\sim$ 400 meV which is remarkably large. Such changes can most likely not be explained by changes in shielding of accumulated surface-charges or repositioning of the Fermi level. A (reversible) surface-reconstruction or even a (reversible) change of chemical composition might be able to explain the data, but without further measurements, we cannot be sure. To the best of my knowledge, neither a structural reconstruction nor a change in \wf{} at the temperatures is question has yet been reported in the literature for $W:VO_2$. In conjunction with the measurements carried out by Nir Kedem, the experiments reported in the literature and those summarised in Figure \ref{fig:vox3}, it has to be assumed that the changes in \wf{} seen at around 120 \& 170 K are not explained by the known \emph{MIT} of vanadium-dioxide. The difference in \cpd{} between heating up and cooling down seen in Figure \ref{fig:vox1} might be taken as evidence for hysteresis at lower temperatures than previously observed, but the data is sparse, so no conclusive explanation can be drawn from them. Figure \ref{fig:vox2} on the whole corroborates what was observed in the initial, relatively inaccurate experiment even though the size of the observed effect is greater, but nothing more can be concluded from these measurements alone.\\
Concentrating on the temperature range 180 to 300 K, a change in \wf{} of $\sim$ 150 meV is seen in both in Figure \ref{fig:vox2} and, more clearly, in Figure \ref{fig:vox3}. A change of $\sim$ 150 meV was also reported by Ko REF KO THIN VAOX during the \emph{MIT} of vanadium-dioxide, but they observed a decrease instead of the increase in \wf{} seen here. The difference between the sample used in that research and the one used here is the presence of tungsten as dopant. Tungsten has more valence electrons than vanadium even in its elemental state and certainly has more valence electrons than vanadium in its oxide and tungsten should therefore act as n-type dopant. This is in accordance with the sign of \spv{} observed in Figure \ref{fig:vox3} and might also explain why the \wf{} increases in our case. If negative charge carriers are trapped at the surface, they might pose an additional barrier for electrons to leave the material, hence a greater work function.\\
Lastly, we will concentrate on the measurement of the \spv{} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vox3}. A significant \spv{} is observed below 280 K, at 240 K the \spv{} is at its maximum of $\sim 120$ mV and below 220 K \spv{} is reduced back to levels comparable to those at room temperature. A significant \spv{} signal is therefore observed in the same temperature range that was identified for \emph{MIT} in the resistivity measurements. In the metallic rutile configuration, no \spv{} is observed and none is expected. As the energy gap of the material gradually widens, the \spv{} gradually increases because gradually less thermally free carriers can shield trapped surface charges in the dark condition. As a result, band bending and hence observed \spv{} gradually increase. On first sight, the gradual decrease in \spv{} signal might be puzzling. One would expect the trend for the \spv{} to continue, after all, the idea behind low temperature \spv{} is to counteract thermally free carriers and increase the influence of electron-hole pairs created by absorption of light. However, the observation made here can be explained if one recalls that vanadium-dioxide is undergoing a metal to \emph{insulator} transition and that for an insulator, the energy gap is expected to be relatively large. Looking at the spectrum of illumination, Figure \ref{fig:ledspec}, a clear cut off below 400 nm is seen. 400 nm radiation corresponds to a photon energy of $\sim$ 3.1 eV so if the energy gap in $VO_2$ becomes larger than this, no carriers can be created by illumination or rather: only a minute fraction of incident photons corresponding to the minute fraction of photons at the low-wavelength tail of the LED will have sufficient energy to create free carriers. Therefore, the sample is no longer saturated by illumination and a signifcant drop in observed \spv{} signal is expected. Assuming a gap of 3.1 eV or larger is not unreasonable for an insulator, neither would the observed \wf{} of $\sim$ 5.2 be a contradiction. Similar experiments with an extended spectral range or a more detailed study of spectral surface photo voltage might serve to verify the results obtained for this material here, but they are out of scope of this project. Vanadium-dioxide was, above all, chosen as a system to show a viable \spv{}(T) measurement, to serve as a proof of concept for measuring temperature dependent \spv{} with the Lakeshore cryogenic system and we are carefully optimistic in concluding that the results presented here can serve as such a proof.
