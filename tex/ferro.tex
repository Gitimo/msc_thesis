\section{Introduction and Motivation}
The goal of this part of the project was to see whether a well known ferroelectric polymer could be used to enhance the efficiency of solar cell when applied as a thin film to its surface.\\
Solar cells convert light energy directly into electrical energy via the photoelectric effect and thus they are a proven method for obtaining sustainable energy. Significant amounts of research effort are put into exploring new materials and their possibilities as well as into improving existing types of solar cells. New materials for solar energy conversion and the switch to sustainable methods of energy conversion are one of the focuses of the Optoelectronic Materials Group at the Weizmann Institute of Science~\cite{cahen_energylimitations,cahen_opvlimitations,cahen_energycrisis}. Broadly, one may divide the research approaches of solar energy conversion into two main categories: either a high quality, high cost approach that tries to maximise ultimate efficiencies as much as possible or a \enhyphen{low} quality, low cost approach that tries to strike an advantageous balance between production costs and obtained efficiency. The former is, for example, represented by \enhyphen{simple} single junction III-IV solar cells~\cite{schermer_35} and \enhyphen{complex} multi-junctions that maximise the usage of the available solar spectrum in each of their layers separately. Efficiencies as high as $\sim$\SI{38}{\percent} have been reported \cite{efftab} and even higher efficiencies may be reached when utilising light-concentrator schemes~\footnote{An added advantage of concentrators is that they allow collection of light over a great area with relatively cheap lens materials and minimise the area necessary for the costly actual cell.}. The second approach focuses more on new materials or tries to combine the advantages of wet-chemical production processes, namely their versatility and low cost, with solar cell preparation. Recently, perovskite solar cells are a notable contender in this group\cite{saar} but a lot of focus on \enhyphen{more traditional} materials still exists. Here, the Cahen group has made significant advances by studying electronic transport through layers of molecular surface modifications~\cite{cahen_alkyltransport}, by showing how those modifications influence the work function of the underlying substrate~\cite{tal_wfcontrol} and how such modifications can be applied to crystalline silicon in easy and scalable ways~\cite{cahen_alkyl}. These efforts made possible inversion layer type solar cells. To explain a little further: in a \enhyphen{typical} silicon solar cell a p-n-junction is created by changing the type of dopant introduced into molten silicon during cell growth. This process is relatively costly in terms of energy and, accordingly, in terms of money as well. In an inversion-layer type solar cell, on the other hand, only one type of material (either p- or n-type doped silicon) is used and the necessary junction is formed by excluding one type of charge carriers in a thin layer directly the cell surface by a strong electric field created by chemisorbed dipolar molecules~\cite{ann_inversion} or by, for example, a field effect induced by an aluminium-oxide layer grown on top of the substrate~\cite{ann_inversion2}. In this respect, the attempt at creating a comparable effect by a physisorbed ferroelectric polymer is a logical continuation of ongoing work in the Cahen group. The topic of ferroelectrics and solar cells has received much attention in general~\cite{yuan_ferrooverview}. Inversion of silicon by the ferroelectric polymer used in this project was shown as early as 1987~\cite{langlois_inversion} and more recently incorporated into a c-Si/organic Schottky type sell~\cite{liu_THEpaper} comparable to the ones investigated in the Cahen group, which served as a starting point for this project. Furthermore, one significant loss mechanism in solar cells is unwanted (surface) recombination of created charge carriers. The efficiency of this loss mechanism is dependent on the product of the two types of charge carriers and therefore, if one type of charge carrier can be excluded from the surface or charge separation inside the bulk can be aided, a reduction of losses is expected. The ferroelectric polymer has been implemented as a \enhyphen{sandwich} layer in organic photovoltaic cells and was shown to increase their efficiency~\cite{asadi_opvenhancement}. It was shown that this effect is a direct consequence of the polymer's ferroelectric polarisation~\cite{yuan_opvenhancement} by aiding with charge separation~\cite{nalwa_enhancedopvchargesep} and novel concepts, such as ferroelectrically enhanced graphene/silicon cells are being explored~\cite{yu_gr-fe-si-cell} as well.\\
Having established why the combination of ferroelectric polymer with silicon solar cells may be of potential societal benefit and research interest, the polymer material will be introduced in detail in the following Section. In Section \ref{sec:exptech} the diverse experimental methods used throughout this project are introduced from a theoretical standpoint and in Section \ref{sec:expwork} the experimental approach is outlined and the obtained results are reported and discussed. The concluding Section gives a short summary of this part of the project and tries to analyse its failures as well as partial successes.

\section{Ferroelectricity}
Ferro\emph{electricity} is best described in analogy to the known phenomenon ferro\emph{magnetism}. A ferromagnetic material is a material that can retain a magnetisation even when the external magnetic field is removed. Ferromagnetism lies at the heart of virtually all permanent magnets. In analogy, a ferroelectric material, is a material that can retain an electric polarisation even when the external electric field is removed. In this context \enquote{poling} is the process of giving the material a remnant polarisation. To understand polarisation, a description in terms of dipoles is illuminating. The following discussion is largely based on Atkins~\cite[Chapters 18.1 to 18.3 and 20.10]{atkins} but is expressed in terms of macroscopic physical quantities instead of in microscopic thermodynamic quantities,~\eg{} susceptibility instead of polarisability. When an external electric field is applied to a material, bound charges elements are displaced: positive charge moves with the field, negative charge moves against it, setting up a dipole moment even when the material remains electrically neutral. The polarisation density $\vec{P}$ is then defined for a certain volume element $\Delta V$ of the material carrying a certain dipole moment $\Delta \vec{p}$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{P} \equiv \frac{\Delta \vec{p}}{\delta V} \, .
\end{equation}
The relationship between applied electric field $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{P}$ is not always easy to establish. It is therefore practical to introduce the experimentally accessible electric displacement field $\vec{D}$, which is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{D} \equiv \epsilon_0 \vec{E} + \vec{P} \equiv \frac{1}{\mu _0 c^2} \vec{E} + \vec{P} \, ,
\end{equation}
with the permittivity of free space $\epsilon _0 \approx$\SI{8.85e-12}{\farad\per\metre} which is defined by the vacuum permeability $\mu _0$ and the speed of light $c$ as above. In a homogeneous linear isotropic dielectric medium, the polarisation density is proportional to the electric field and related to it by its electric susceptibility $\chi$, a scalar quantity:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{P} = \chi \epsilon_0 \vec{E}
\end{equation}
and the susceptibility is related to the electric permittivity of the material $\epsilon$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\chi +1 = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon _0} \, .
\end{equation}
In anisotropic materials, it is possible that an electric field applied in one direction can lead to a polarisation in a different direction. The scalar susceptibility is therefore replaced by a susceptibility matrix which relates the $n^{\text{th}}$ component of the polarisation to the $m^{\text{th}}$ component of the electric field:
\begin{equation}
	P_n = \sum _m \epsilon _0 \chi _{n,m} E_m
\end{equation}
and in non-linear materials, the linear susceptibility $\chi^{(1)}$ is expanded with second and third-order susceptibilities $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ respectively. Furthermore, because polarisation is dependent on the displacement of charges, \ie{} the reorientation of dipole moments, the susceptibility is also a function of the frequency of the applied electric field. It is entirely possible to apply an electric field that oscillates so quickly that the dipoles simply do not have enough time to rearranges themselves. These effects are succinctly summarised in Maxwell's equations in matter, specifically in his formulation of Gauss' law. In ferroelectric materials, however, the above description usually fails, because the polarisation is not only dependent on the applied field, but also on its own history, \ie{} ferroelectric materials exhibit hysteresis.\\

\label{fig:polplot}
\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:polplot} three polarisation plots, $\vec{P}$ vs. $\vec{E}$, for three different classes of materials are shown. Figure \ref{fig:dielplot} shows the behaviour of a \enhyphen{normal}~\footnote{\ie{} linear, homogeneous, isotropic} dielectric material. The slope of the polarisation curve corresponds to the material's electric permittivity $\epsilon$ and is a constant. Figure \ref{fig:parelplot} depicts the behaviour of a paraelectric material. The \enhyphen{kink} in the curve is explained by the material becoming inherently polarised at an applied electric field: once a certain threshold applied electric field is reached, all previously unaligned dipoles in the material are aligned against the applied field and weaken it to the maximum extent possible for that material. When the external field is removed, the dipoles return to their unaligned state and the material thus loses its polarisation. Lastly, Figure \ref{fig:ferelplot} depicts the polarisation plot of a ferroelectric material. These materials exhibit a spontaneous electric polarisation that can be reversed by an applied field, leading to a hysteretic loop in the polarisation plot. As the applied field strength increases, so does the material's polarisation up to a point where all dipoles are aligned against the applied field. This alignment is retained in the material, leading to a non-zero polarisation at zero applied electric field. When the field is applied in the reverse direction and reaches a sufficient strength, the ordering in the material reverses as well, leading to symmetry around the axes observed in the polarisation plot.\\

\end{figure}
It is usual for a ferroelectric material to lose its ferroelectricity above a material specific Curie temperature $T_C$, \ie{} most ferroelectric materials undergo a ferroelectric/paraelectric phase transition at $T_C$ because the internal dipoles are coupled to the material lattice. Temperature naturally influences the lattice and therefore, the dipoles, see Figure \ref{fig:ferroscheme} for an overview of the structural phases at different temperatures. Ferroelectric transitions are broadly classified into two main groups at the extremes of a continuous spectrum: order-disorder and displacive transitions~\cite[pp. 467 ff.]{kittel}. Order-disorder transitions are relatively simply characterised by the fact that the polarisations in the individual unit cells point in random directions above $T_C$. In a displacive transition, the polarisation of the material becomes unusually large, leading to a \enhyphen{polarisation catastrophe}: the local electric field caused by a displacement of charge is stronger than the elastic restoring force, leading to an asymmetrical shift of charges. In close analogy with ferromagnetism, ferroelectric domains may exist in a ferroelectic material. Each domain is characterised by a polarisation in the same direction, whereas adjacent domains have a polarisation in a different direction. The net polarisation of the material is the vector-sum of the contributions of the individual domain polarisations and the total polarisation of the material can be changed by movement of domain walls or by nucleation of new domains.

\section{Polyvinylidene Difluoride and its Copolymers}

	\label{fig:pvstruct}
\end{figure}
Polyvinylidene difluoride (\pvdf{}) is a ferroelectric polymer that is used on an industrial scale as a speciality plastic. On the industrial level, it is more interesting because of its chemical properties than its ferroelectricity: its melting point, $\sim$\SI{177}{\degreeCelsius}, is relatively low compared to other fluoropolymers and is therefore more easily processed, yet it retains the stability with respect to acids, bases, solvents and heats typical for the fluorofamily. It is an insulator with a relatively low density, $\sim$\SI{1.8}{\gram\per\cubic\centi\metre}, and high mechanical strength. It is therefore often used for piping, wire-insulation, tubing etc. With regards to its ferroelectric behaviour \pvdf{} is often employed as a copolymer which includes trifluoroethylene (\trfe{}) in its chains. These copolymers are collectively referred to as \pvfe{} usually identified by the molar ratio of their constituent difluoro- and trifluoroethylene groups. For this project \pvtr{} was available and except where otherwise specifically noted, the terms \pvdf{} and \pvtr{} may be used synonymously. An approximate chemical structure for \pvtr{} is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:pvstruct}. The structure is only approximate because the exact position of \trfe{} in the chain is random, but will on average approach a distribution that reflects the molar ratio.\\
The \emph{\enhyphen{Encyclopedia of Smart Materials}} devotes an entire Chapter to polyvinylidene difluoride and its copolymers~\cite[pp. 807-820]{encyclopedia} and much of the following discussion is largely based on this excellent summary.\\

Overall, the structure of the (co)polymer is semi-crystalline and will consist of ordered regions of monomer units, crystallites of $\sim$\SIrange{10}{20}{\nano\metre} surrounded by a sea of amorphous, scrambled chains. The polymer may furthermore include regions of head-to-tail bonding (--CH$_2$--CF$_2$--CH$_2$--CF$_2$--) alongside regions of tail-to-tail and/or head-to-head bonding (--CH$_2$--CF$_2$--CF$_2$--CH$_2$-- and --CF$_2$--CH$_2$--CH$_2$--CF$_2$-- respectively) which can be categorised as defects in the crystalline regions of \pvdf{}. In the case of the copolymer, \trfe{} is incorporated atacticly into the molecule, \ie{} the position of the third vinyl-group with respect to the chain~\footnote{Either \enhyphen{in front of} or \enhyphen{behind} the chain} is random. Disregarding these defects, there are four major crystalline forms of \pvdf{} which are described by the way the chains are packed within the crystal lattice: according to their conformations (\emph{trans} (T) or \emph{gauche} (G) linkages), their orientation about the chain axis (\emph{parallel} or \emph{antiparallel}) and the relative directions of adjacent chains (\emph{up-up} when pointing in the same and \emph{down-down} when pointing in opposite directions). Figure \ref{fig:pvdfstruct} depicts two of the the major crystalline forms and it is apparent from the Newman-projections in Figure~\ref{fig:pvfischer} that the all-\emph{trans} $\beta$-phase will be preferred, resulting in a dipole-moment of $\sim$\SI{2.1}{D}~\footnote{The debye is a CGS-unit convenient for molecular dipole-moments. It is exactly equivalent to \SI{1e-21}{\coulomb\metre} divided by the speed of light and  approximately equal to \SI{0.2082}{\elementarycharge\angstrom}.} in pure \pvdf{}~\cite[p. 810]{encyclopedia}. Figure \ref{fig:pvdfunit} compares the orthorhombic unit cells of the $\beta$- and $\alpha$-phases of \pvdf{} and shows an absence of a permanent dipole in the latter. The polymer chain lies along the $\vec{c}$ unit cell vector. Table \ref{tab:pvdflat} summarises the lattice dimensions and angles of pure \pvdf{} in the the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-phase and includes lattice parameters for the $\beta$-phase of \pvfe{} of varying molar ratio. It is apparent that introducing a third Fluorine atom into the unit cell will reduce the net dipolar moment of the monomer unit, but because of atacticity, the net dipole-moment is still parallel to the $\vec{b}$ unit cell vector. The macroscopic effect on the net polarisation may not be as easily inferred because inclusion of \trfe{} may influence the superstructure of the polymer, the ordering of its crystallites and possibly the structure of its ferroelectric domains. The ferroelectric/paraelectric phase transition in \pvdf{} is an order-disorder transition of first order~\cite{takeo}. The $\delta$-phase will not be discussed here.

\end{table}
Because of unfavourable, repulsive van der Waals interactions introduced by the third Fluorine, the melting point of the copolymer decreases with increasing \trfe{} content and for the same reason, incorporating \trfe{} furthermore favours crystallisation into the $\beta$-phase. It can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:pvdfunit} that the Fluorines in the $\alpha$ unit cell are more closely packed. Therefore, melting temperature $T_m$, phase transition temperature $T_C$, degree of crystallinity, remnant polarisation $P_r$ and coercive field $E_C$ are all affected by the \trfe{} content, which is summarised in Table \ref{tab:trfecont}. However, even if the polymer is present in the ferroelectric phase, its ferroelectric domains will non the less be oriented in all crystallographically allowed directions. For an observable net polarisation to develop, the polymer therefore has to be \enhyphen{poled}: in a strong electric field, dipolar ordering will be added to crystalline ordering. Elevated annealing temperatures will help with this process even if $T_C$ is exceeded, because as the polymer cools down, the preferred ferroelectric phase will crystallise with a higher degree of oriented ferroelectric domains. The effect of annealing temperature on crystallinity and remnant polarisation for a \pvfe{} with \SI{32}{\mole\percent} \trfe{} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:annealtemp}. Poling is usually accomplished either by electroding the polymer surfaces or by the use of a corona discharge where charge is injected into the polymer. For this project, electrode poling, both contacted and non-contacted, was attempted. Lastly, it was reported that \pvdf{} thin films obtained from Langmuir-Blodgett (\lb{}) deposition crystallise directly in the $\beta$-phase and undergo self-polarisation~\cite{chen_lbpvdf,kliem_lbpvdf}. However, \lb{} deposition was not easily available during the course of this project and this route could therefore not be explored.

\subsection{\pvdf{} Nanoparticles}
Apart from bulk material and thin films, \pvdf{} can also be prepared as nanoparticles (\nps{}) and as nanostructured material. While interesting, \pvdf{} nanostructures require sophisticated preparation steps, whereas \pvdf{} \nps{} can easily be synthesised by a scalable, solution chemistry self-assembly mechanism which sidesteps the otherwise necessary high annealing temperatures, rendering this route especially interesting for the application with organic photovoltaic cells (\opvs{}). The reproducible synthesis was first described by Xiao~\etal{}~\cite{NPsynthesis} and their paper serves as a basis for the following discussion of the properties of \pvdf{} \nps{}. To achieve self-assembly of \pvdf{}-chains into nanoparticles, the polymer is first dissolved in a \enhyphen{good} solvent, such as acetone, and then an interface with a \enhyphen{bad} solvent, such as water, is formed. At the interface, \pvdf{} chains tend to coils in on themselves because of the strong hydrophobic interaction between water and fluorine in \pvdf{}. This process is supported by precipitating the \nps{} out with the help of a high speed centrifuge at speeds around \SI{20000}{rpm}. Because water cannot form hydrogen bonds with the polymer~\cite{silverstein}, an increase in entropy results, causing subsequent polymer chains to aggregate at the surface of the forming \np{}. The \nps{} crystallise in \pvdf{}'s amorphous, non-ferroelectric phase but can be converted to the crystalline, ferroelectrically  active $\beta$-phase by heating above its Curie temperature. This is achieved by refluxing the suspension of \nps{}, which can subsequently be processed further. Spin-coating, evaporating or simply mixing the suspension with other chemicals allow for the \nps{} to be included in \opvs{} in a non-destructive, controlled manner: for example, Xiao~\etal{} could independently optimise the nanoparticle size and their coverage in the solar cell. \pvdf{} is a non-conducting polymer and as such increases the series resistance of the solar cell, counteracting its positive influences on charge carrier recombination lifetimes. For the optimised coverage of \SI{18}{\percent}, the solar cell's efficiency could be improved by \SI{1.9}{\percent} from \SI{4.74}{\percent} to \SI{6.64}{\percent} which is a sizeable relative improvement of $\sim$\SI{29}{\percent}!

\section{Experimental Techniques}
\label{sec:exptech}
\subsection{Contact Potential Difference and Surface Photovoltage}
Chapter \ref{chap:spv} deals exclusively with the contact potential difference (\cpd{}) and the surface photovoltage (\spv{}), so any theoretical or practical explanation will be skipped here.\\
For the scope of this Chapter, it is sufficient to mention that \cpd{} measures the work function of a sample compared to a known reference and that \spv{} can be an indicator of charges trapped at the surface and the overall quality of a chemical or physical surface modification. Previous work carried out at the Cahen group often focused on chemical surface modifications of silicon and it was shown for a range of chemicals that a (surface) dipole can influence the work function of the underlying silicon substrate. It is therefore assumed that successfully adsorbed \pvdf{} should influence the work function of silicon as measured by \cpd{} and that the direction of this influence be tune-able by changing the polarisation-direction of the ferroelectric polymer. It is furthermore assumed that a change in \spv{} may be taken as an indication of either less surface recombination or the presence of an electrical field at the surface.

\subsection{Determination of Excess Carrier Lifetimes}
In semiconductors, photogenerated excess charge carriers may recombine via different mechanisms. The effects of each of these mechanisms can be described by individual recombination rates, $S$ or by individual characteristic recombination \enhyphen{lifetimes}, $\tau$. Generally, a distinction has to be made between recombination in the bulk as expressed by the bulk carrier lifetime \tbulk{} and recombination at surfaces as expressed by the surface lifetime \tsurf{}. These two lifetimes combine to an effective carrier lifetime \teff{} given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{efflifetime}
	\frac{1}{\teff} = \frac{1}{\tbulk} + \frac{1}{\tsurf} \, .
\end{equation}
For the bulk, three mechanism can be identified: radiative recombination (also known as band-to-band recombination), \trad{}, where carriers of opposite charge neutralise each other and emit a photon of corresponding energy; Shockley-Read-Hall recombination , \tsrh{}, where carriers recombine via traps within the bandgap and Auger recombination, \taug{}, where opposite carriers recombine and transfer their energy to a third carrier, which subsequently gives off its excess energy in the form of heat. In the presence of these mechanisms, \tbulk{}, is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{bulklifetime}
	\frac{1}{\tbulk} = \frac{1}{\trad} + \frac{1}{\tsrh} + \frac{1}{\taug} \, .
\end{equation}
For indirect bandgap semiconductors such as silicon, \trad{} is typically large compared to the other times and may be neglected in Equation \eqref{bulklifetime}. Conversely, for (high quality) direct bandgap semiconductors such as GaAs, \trad{} is short and \tsrh{} is typically large and may often be neglected~\cite{gaaslifetime}. Because Auger recombination is a three-particle process, it is inherently less probable than its two-particle counterparts. However, the Auger recombination rate is a cubic function of excess carrier density and therefore becomes dominant at higher carrier concentrations~\cite{auger}. Surfaces are natural defects in the crystal structure and as such provide ample opportunity for carriers to recombine. It is more difficult to generally relate the surface recombination velocities \ssurf{} to a surface recombination lifetime which can be used in Equation \eqref{efflifetime}. For example, the two large surfaces of a wafer might have different recombination velocities and in very high quality semiconductors, even the comparatively small surfaces at the edges may influence the overall effective lifetime~\cite{edgerecom}.\\
One method to measure the effective lifetime of the excess carriers of a semiconductor is to convert its photoconductance into its excess carrier density via known mobility functions:
\begin{equation}
\label{carrierbalance}
	\Delta n = \frac{\Delta \sigma}{qW (\mu_n \mu_p)} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the conductance, $\Delta n$ denotes the excess carrier density, $W$ is the sample thickness, $q$ the charge and $\mu_n$ \& $\mu_p$ are the mobilities of negative and positive carriers respectively. The situation is complicated because the mobilities generally are functions of the doping densities and also of the excess carrier density~\cite{sintononline}. Therefore, some knowledge about the sample is required and modelling the characteristics of the sample is generally applied. The carrier concentration in Equation \eqref{carrierbalance} can be converted to lifetimes by solving the continuity equations to obtain:
\begin{equation}
\label{taugeneral}
	\teff (\Delta n) = \frac{\Delta n (t)}{G(t) - \frac{d\Delta n}{dt} } \, ,
\end{equation}
in which $G(t)$ is the photogeneration rate and $\Delta n$ is, again, the excess carrier density~\cite{nagel_lifetime}. Equation \eqref{taugeneral} is generally valid and was even derived for non-uniform photogeneration in the presence of significant surface recombination. Most measurements are realised by flashing a strong light on the sample and monitoring the time-evolution of its photoconductance via a radio-frequency bridge. When the duration of the flash is long, a quasi-steady state situation is achieved in which the excess carrier density can be seen as constant in time. Equation \eqref{taugeneral} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\label{qsspd}
	\teff (\Delta n) = \frac{\Delta n (t)}{G(t)} \, ,
\end{equation}
which is a good approximation for short lifetimes. A drawback of this method is that the generation rate must be known. Therefore the intensity of the flash has to be monitored, corrected for reflectivity and absorption by the sample. The opposite situation, a transient photoconductance decay measurement, is achieved then the flash is very brief and no illumination reaches the sample during the measurement. Then, the photogeneration rate can be assumed to be zero and Equation \eqref{taugeneral} can be solved to obtain:
\begin{equation}
\label{tpd}
	\teff (\Delta n) = - \frac{t}{\ln (\Delta n)} \, .
\end{equation}
This approach is only valid for relatively long lifetimes, but the intensity of the flash does not need not be monitored and reflectivity \& absorption of the sample do not need to be known, either. The combined quasi-steady-state, quasi-transient approach as described by Equation \eqref{taugeneral} yields the most accurate results, but is also the most involved. For this approach to work, the intensity of the flash must be measured in real-time and the absolute conductance of the sample must be known, as described by Sinton \emph{et~al.}~\cite{sinton1,sinton2}.\\
In all cases, if one is interested in the surface recombination velocities or lifetimes, \teff{} needs to be translated into \tbulk{}. Experimentally, this can most easily be achieved by using a high quality substrate in which $\tbulk \gg \teff$. If the latter is not the case, then there is an exact equation that can be used for transient measurements:
\begin{equation}
\label{exacttransient}
	\ssurf = \sqrt{D \left( \frac{1}{\teff} - \frac{1}{\tbulk} \right)} \tan \left( \frac{W}{2} \sqrt{D \left( \frac{1}{\teff} - \frac{1}{\tbulk} \right)} \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the minority carrier diffusivity and the other symbols have their usual meaning~\cite{luke_lifetime}. A series of approximations to that equation exists and they are valid if $\teff \gg \frac{W^2}{\pi ^2 D}$ for transient measurements and if $\teff \gg \frac{W^2}{12 D}$ for quasi-steady state measurements~\cite{sproul_lifetime}. 

\subsection{Infrared Spectroscopy}
\sisetup{per-mode = reciprocal-positive-first}
Infrared (\ir{}) spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy which employs light with energies just below the visible spectrum, \ie{} with wavelengths longer than $\sim$ 800 nm. It is common to express the spectrum in terms of its frequency and a typical unit is reciprocal centimeters (\si{\per\centi\metre}), also called \enhyphen{wavenumbers} and to divide it into three broad regions: \enhyphen{near \ir{}} ($\sim$ \SIrange{14e3}{4e3}{\per\centi\metre}), \enhyphen{mid \ir{}} ($\sim$ \SIrange{4e3}{0.4e3}{\per\centi\metre}) and \enhyphen{far \ir{}} ($\sim$ \SIrange{400}{10}{\per\centi\metre}), where each region approximately excites different types of vibrations ranging from harmonic to rotational-vibrational excitations. Vibrational modes are \ir{}-active if there is a change in dipole moment which enables interaction with the electric field of the radiation. Therefore \ir{} spectroscopy is very sensitive to the chemical environment of the sample under investigation and is especially frequently used in organic chemistry. Practically, instead of scanning each wavenumber individually, the sample is often illuminated by a wide range of radiation and decomposed by a Fourier transformation into its components, yielding Fourier Transform \ir{} (\ftir{}) spectroscopy which shortens the time of the measurement and allows detecting small quantities of and minute changes in a sample.\\%

\label{fig:irscheme}
\end{figure}
To study thin films that are either physically or chemically adsorbed to a substrate surface, it is useful exclude interaction of the substrate with the \ir{}-radiation and to maximise the interactions interactions that are of interest. One method that accomplishes  both these goals is Attenuated Total Reflectance (\atr{}) \ftir{} where the \ir{} beam is directed into a crystal of high refractive index and reflects internally from its surfaces. Refer to Figure \ref{fig:irscheme} for a schematic of the \atr{} method. The thin film under investigation is pressed onto the crystal to form an intimate contact so that an evanescent \ir{} wave can project into it, see Figure \ref{fig:irwave}. There, part of the \ir{} spectrum is absorbed by the sample and the now somewhat reduces beam is returned into the crystal where it can be internally reflected to be projected into the thin film again multiple times, greatly attenuating the absorption of the thin film. As can be deduced from Figure \ref{fig:iroverview}, the reflectance is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{atr-reflectance}
	R(\lambda)^N = (1-a_{\lambda} \cdot d_e)^N \, ,
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of reflections taking place at the crystal/thin film interface~\footnote{For the case of Figure \ref{fig:irscheme} $N=3$}, $a_{\lambda}$ is the wavelength specific absorptivity of the thin film and $d_e$ is its effective thickness. One complication that needs to be mentioned is that \atr{} spectra are not linear with wavenumber CITE VILAN and therefore sometimes difficult to compare to transmittance spectra. In the context of this study, that complication is somewhat alleviated because we will mainly compare \atr{}-\ftir{} spectra relative to other other \atr{}-\ftir{} spectra to assess whether or not a phase transition has occurred in the thin film sample and will for the most part not need absolute quantification of the samples.
\subsection{Ellipsometry and Contact Profilometry}
\subsubsection{Ellipsometry}
Generally, ellipsometry is an optical technique for investigating the dielectric properties of (layers of) thin films of material(s) on reflective surfaces. It is an indirect method insofar as that the information obtained from an ellipsometry measurement cannot directly be converted into the dielectric properties of the thin film under investigation. Therefore, the measured data must be compared to a model and the success of an ellipsometry measurement hinges on the quality of that model. In its most common form, ellipsometry measures the properties of light reflected from the surface of a sample. The set-up consists of a light source, a polariser, the sample, an analyser and a detector. Light with known, elliptical polarisation is employed, hence the name. This incident light can be decomposed into two components: the \emph{s} component where the electrical field of the radiation oscillates parallel to the sample and perpendicular to the plane of incidence and the \emph{p} component where the field oscillates parallel to the plane of incidence. Ellipsometry measures the complex reflectance $\rho$ of the sample which consists of an amplitude component $\Psi$ and a phase difference $\Delta$ according to
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \tan \left( \Psi \right) \exp \left( i \Delta \right) \, .
\end{equation}
The complex nature of the reflectance as measured by ellipsometry is readily apparent from the equation above. Per wavelength, one pair of $\Psi$ \& $\Delta$ can be obtained. Therefore, to reach more optical parameters, a broad spectrum is often employed in ellipsometry. For the purposes of this study, ellipsometry was exclusively used to find the thickness of a layer of interest on a substrate of known composition and thickness.
\subsubsection{Contact Profilometry}
Contact profilometry is a conceptually exceedingly simple technique to study surfaces and their roughness. A small diamond tip is brought in contact with a surface and moved across a predefined path along that surface and vertical displacement of the stylus is measured accurately. Depending of the type of surface under investigation displacements of \SI{10}{\nano\metre} up to \SI{1}{\micro\metre} can typically be measured with a lateral resolution depending primarily on the size of the tip-apex, where resolutions of $\sim$\SI{20}{\nano\metre} are feasible. The diamond tip of a record player scanning a vinyl record and producing an audible, analogue signal is a very fitting analogy for contact profilometers in use today.
\subsection{Electron Microscopy}
While a thorough explanation of the function and uses of electron microscopy is out of the scope of this paper, a brief introduction to Scanning Electron Microscopy (\sem{}) for the visualisation of nanometre sized objects will still be given. \sem{} is a type of electron microscopy in which a sample is raster-scanned with a focused beam of electrons. This focused beam causes the sample to emit several types of signals: secondary electrons emitted by atoms in the sample, backscattered electrons, x-rays and light of varying wavelength and intensity, all of which can be detected by sophisticated microscopes. The resolution of the microscope is not achieved as in an optical microscope or as in a Transmission Electron Microscope (\tem{}) where the focusing the beam and the wavelength are determining, but rather by a translation of the size of the raster on the sample to the size of the raster on the detector. Thus, \sem{} can cover up to six orders of magnitude of magnification and sample features at very different length scales can be investigated. Because the sample is subjected to a continuous beam of electrons, it needs to be conductive and grounded to get rid off excess charge. Charge accumulated on the sample can lead to unwanted interactions and artefacts in the visual reconstruction of the sample. For the purpose of this study, \sem{} was used to investigate the surface morphology of deposited thin films of a polymer, \pvdf{}, and nanoparticles synthesised from the same polymer. \sem{} was also used to obtain typical nanoparticle dimensions.
\subsection{IV-Curves}
Current-Voltage curves (IV-curves) of a semiconductor or solar cell can reveal a lot of information about the semiconductor or cell under investigation, not withstanding its conceptual simplicity. In a straight forward measurement, two contact are electrically connected to the sample and the current resulting from a precisely known applied voltage is measured accurately. With an appropriate illumination set-up, dark and light IV-curves can be obtained and compared. For an ideal diode, the dark current is given by the diode equation:
\begin{equation}
	I = I_0 \left( \exp \left( \frac{qV}{nk_BT} \right) -1 \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the reverse saturation bias current, $n$ is the ideality factor and the remaining symbols have their usual meaning. Under light conditions, a steady-state current is induced that shifts the IV-curve down, depending on the size of the photon-current, their spectrum and the cell's spectral response. A \enhyphen{real} diode will also include parasitic resistances such as series resistance $R_S$ and shunt resistance $R_{SH}$ and the measured IV-curve will more closely follow a form corresponding to the equation:
\begin{equation}
	I = I_0 \left( \exp \left( \frac{q(V+IR_S)}{nk_BT} \right) -\frac{V+IR_S}{R_{SH}} \right) \, .
\end{equation}
As can be seen from the above equation, the parasitic resistances can be obtained from the derivative of of the IV-curve at its intersections with the axes and to put it more colloquially, parasitic resistances will result in the IV-curve being \enhyphen{less square} than than of its ideal counterpart. The presence of back-diodes will result in a \emph{S}-shaped or otherwise generally misshapen IV-curves and while it is often useful to extract precise cell parameters such as fill-factor, open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current, optical inspection of the IV-curve alone may already reveal key issues with a cell under investigation.

Figure \ref{fig:dlssetup} shows the main components: (laser) source, sample cell, detectors, auto-correlator and a computer for data-sampling. Two detectors allow for measurement of relative intensity and thus help reduce unwanted noise from fluctuations in laser intensity. Figure \ref{fig:dlsnoise} shows how different particle sizes lead to different \enhyphen{noise} signatures in the measured signal.}
\label{fig:dlscheme}
\end{figure}
Dynamic Light Scattering (\dls{}) is most commonly used to analyse nanoparticles, specifically it can be used to determine the size of nanoparticles in solution. The optical set-up of a \dls{} experiment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dlssetup}, a typical example of the the obtained optical signal is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dlsnoise}. A laser illuminates the sample, some amount of light is scattered by particles in solution and its intensity as a function of time is determined by the detector at an angle to the path of the laser beam. A second detector in the direct path of the light is used to subtract fluctuations in laser intensity. The \enhyphen{noise} in the measured relative intensity of the two detectors is a direct consequence of the (Brownian) motion of nanoparticles in solution and will be used to extract particle size. As particles move into and out of the path of the laser, more or less light will be scattered toward the detector. Furthermore, a particle that moves about but stays within the path of the beam for a certain delay time $\tau$ will continue to scatter light. Therefore, the evolution of the \enhyphen{noise} in time can be understood in terms of an autocorrelation function. The mathematical treatment of the signal from a population of nanoparticles with different sizes is complicated and mathematically ill posed. To overcome this difficulty experimentally, restrictions on the size distribution have to be supplied. The following discussion will be restricted to a nanoparticle population of a single size so as not to exceed the scope of this project. For such a population, the autocorrelation function
\begin{equation}
	C(\tau) = \sum _{t=0}^T I(t)\cdot I(t + \tau) \, ,
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the total time of the experiment, $I(t)$ is the intensity at time $t$ and $I(t + \tau)$ is the intensity at time $t+\tau$, will also be given by a simple exponential decay:
\begin{equation}
	C(\tau) = \exp (-2 \Gamma \tau) + B \, ,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is a baseline intensity and where $\Gamma$ is obtained by a data-fit and is related to the (translational) diffusion coefficient $D_t$ by the scattering vector $q$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma = D_t \cdot q^2 = D_t \left( \frac{4 \pi n}{\lambda} \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right) ^2 \, .
\end{equation}
In the last equation $n$ is the refractive index of the medium, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of scattered light and $\theta$ is the scattering angle. Finally, $D_t$ as determined from the data-fit can be used in the Stokes-Einstein relation for Brownian motion to find the apparent hydrodynamic diameter $D_h$ of the suspended particles:
\begin{equation}
\label{diameter}
	D_h = \frac{k_B T}{3\pi \eta D_t} \, .
\end{equation}
Here, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature and $\eta$ is the viscosity of the suspending medium. As can easily be seen in Equation \eqref{diameter}, the determined particle diameter is directly proportional to the absolute temperature $T$, however, the viscosity of the medium is usually also very sensitively dependent on temperature and a specific value for $\eta$ needs to be supplied for the measurement. For practical purposes, the viscosity of typical (mixtures of) solvents in a range of temperatures is internally tabulated by software, as are their refractive indices. Therefore, the user of a \dls{} apparatus supplies the type of solvent used, the machine monitors the temperature during the experiment and carries out the necessary calculations and data-fitting routines. It is important to note that, for a successful size determination via \dls{}, a solution of nanoparticles should be sufficiently dilute to avoid clusters of nanoparticles while at the same time being concentrated enough to allow for measurable scattering intensities. Furthermore, the Stokes-Einstein relation assumes rigid, spherical particles so the apparent diameter of a soft, ovoid particle may significantly differ from its true dimensions.\\

\section{Experimental Approach, Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:expwork}
\subsection{Sample Preparation}
\subsubsection{\sih{} Substrates}
Hydrogen passivated n-type silicon (100) with either a resistance of \SIrange{1}{4}{\ohm\metre} or a resistance of \SIrange{1}{5}{\milli\ohm\metre} is prepared according to a standard procedure: pieces of suitable size are cut from a wafers with a thickness of $\sim$\SIlist{300;500}{\micro\metre} with a diamond tip cutter, swiped off with ethyl-acetate to remove residual dust from cutting and successively sonicated for three minutes each in ethyl-acetate, acetone, methanol and water to remove organic and inorganic contaminants. Between each successive sonication step, the pieces are rinsed off with the \enhyphen{new} solvent to avoid solvent cross-contamination. The pieces are microwave-treated in a plasma at \SI{100}{\watt} with a flow of \SI{1}{\cubic\centi\metre\per\minute} \oxy{} and \SI{1.5}{\cubic\centi\metre\per\minute} Ar for 3 minutes. This treatment oxidises the silicon and carbonises possible organic contaminants. Subsequently, samples are rinsed with pure water (\SI{18}{\mega\ohm\centi\metre} at \SI{20}{\degreeCelsius}) to remove residual contaminants and then immersed in \SI{2}{\percent} HF etching solution for 1 minute. The strong acid removes the oxide and creates a hydrophobic \sih{} surface, which is rinsed with water to remove residual acid. The microwave treatment is repeated, the sample is rinsed again, etched again in HF and subsequently rinsed shortly to avoid possible oxidation by water. All chemicals are \SI{99.9}{\percent} purity or higher. During this process, the pieces are handled with clean plastic tweezers that underwent the same sonication steps prior to experimentation. To avoid contamination, one set of tweezers is set aside for exclusive use with HF. To avoid oxidation by air, samples are either directly further processed or stored in the inert atmosphere of a glovebox ($<\num{5}$ppm \oxy{} \& \water{}).\\
The procedure is practised until the surface layer thickness as determined by ellipsometry is reproducibly thinner than \SI{10}{\angstrom} and carrier lifetimes in high purity float-zone Si are measured at different stages during the cleaning procedure.\\
Hydrogen passivated n-type silicon (111) with a resistance of \SIrange{72}{88}{\ohm\metre} is prepared according to a similar procedure: the etch in HF is replaced by either a buffered-oxide-etch (\boe{}) or by treatment with ammonium fluoride, NH$_4$F.
\subsubsection{\pvtr{} Thin Films}
\pvdf{} thin films are spin-cast on \sih{} from solutions of different organic solvents at different concentrations ranging from \SIrange{1}{5}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} to investigate the influence of the solvent on thin film morphology and to allow for control over the thin film thickness. Acetone, oxygen-free dimethylformamide (\dmf{}), water-free tetrahydrofuran (\thf{}) and cyclohexanone are used as solvents. Unless otherwise noted, \SI{100}{\micro\litre} of \pvdf{} solution is pipetted onto freshly prepared \sih{} and spun for \SI{5}{\second} at \SI{500}{rpm} to distribute the solution evenly and then spun for \SI{40}{\second} at \SI{4000}{rpm} to achieve a thin film the thickness of which is determined from ellipsometry and profilometry.\\
The samples were annealed on a hotplate for different times ranging from \SI{30}{\minute} to \enhyphen{over night} at temperatures ranging from \SIrange{120}{140}{\degreeCelsius}. The samples were either heated gradually from room temperature to anneal temperature or placed on a preheated hotplate, because it was found that rapid thermal annealing may favour crystallisation of the $\beta$-phase~\cite{kang_annealspeed}. Similarly, samples were either allowed to cool gradually or thermally quenched by placing on a metal plate in an ice-bath. Poling was attempted with two different set-ups at different terminal voltages ranging from \SIrange{18}{900}{\volt} for different times ranging from \SI{30}{\minute} to \enhyphen{over night} at temperatures between room temperature and annealing temperature.\\
The \pvdf{} surface is either directly contacted or freely placed inside an electric field set up between the substrate and a parallel plate above the \pvdf{} surface. In the former case, two series-connected \SI{9}{\volt} batteries are the voltage source. The bottom electrode is a conductive piece of copper which is connected by a screw to the source. The top electrode is a microscopy slide which is coated with a flat layer of aluminium by thermal evaporation on one side. It is contacted to the source by a strip of conductive adhesive tape. The backside of the sample is scratched, InGa eutectic is applied and the sample is firmly placed on the bottom electrode. The top electrode is placed directly onto the \pvdf{} surface and weighed down with a suitable piece of metal. Neglecting possible voltage drops in the contacts, the electrodes and the silicon substrate, this set up should develop a field of $\sim$\SIrange{18}{180}{\mega\volt\per\metre} in the polymer layer for a polymer thickness between \SIrange{100}{10}{\nano\metre} respectively, close to or well above the coercive field strength of \pvtr{} of $\sim$\SI{70}{\mega\volt\per\metre}, see Table \ref{tab:trfecont}. To put this into perspective: the dielectric strength of air is $\sim$\SIrange{2}{3}{\mega\volt\per\metre}~\cite{airbreakdown}, while comparable (co-)polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) 78:22 and polytetrafluoroethylene~\footnote{better known as \enhyphen{Teflon}} experience electrical breakdown at fields of \SI{207+-40}{\mega\volt\per\metre} and \SI{145+-95}{\mega\volt\per\metre} respectively~\cite{polymerbreakdown,teflonbreakdown}. The field strength in this device is therefore assumed to be above the coercive field strength of \pvdf{} and below its electrical breakdown field, at least for thin films with thickness $\gtrsim$\SI{15}{\nano\metre}. Simultaneous annealing and poling could be achieved by placing the poling device on a hotplate. In this configuration there was a danger of burning the devices cables with the surface of the hotplate, so care had to be taken to avoid touching one with the other and the device was constantly supervised during annealing.\\
The contact-less poling device employed a high-voltage source. The bottom electrode was the same piece of copper, placed on a thick plastic insulator with a \SI{20}{\centi\metre} long vertical rod attached to it. Attached to the rod, movable along it, was a piece of insulator that had a \SI{15}{\centi\metre} by \SI{15}{\centi\metre} aluminium plate attached to it. The source was connected to the plate via an inlet for a conductive screw in the insulating holder. The surface of the aluminium could not be assumed to be flat and would therefore not serve as a top electrode directly. Thus, a silicon wafer of low resistivity was coated with a flat layer of aluminium by thermal evaporation and was connected to the metal plate with conductive paste. The top electrode assembly was lowered above the sample and the high voltage source was turned up to a value just below the electrical breakdown of air which sets an upper limit for the electric field strength inside the polymer layer of just below $\sim$\SIrange{2e6}{3e6}{\volt\per\metre}~\cite{airbreakdown}. This is about one order of magnitude lower than the coercive field of \pvtr{}~\cite[p. 813]{encyclopedia}. However, even such a \enhyphen{low} electric field should induce an observable polarisation by nucleation of ferroelectric domains in \pvdf{}~\cite[pp. 812 ff.]{encyclopedia}. Specifically, Ducharme~\etal{}~\cite{ducharme_finitesize} found that nucleation processes can take place in films with a thickness $>$\SI{15}{\nano\metre} and that the coercive field falls dramatically with increased temperatures. When the phase transition temperature is exceeded during annealing and recrystallisation in the $\beta$-phase takes place inside the electric field, dipole-ordering is energetically preferred at least to some extent.\\
The \pvdf{} thin films are characterised by \enhyphen{relative} \cpd{} \& \spv{}, by \ftir{}, by the  carrier lifetimes in their substrate and their morphology is investigated by \sem{}. In this context \enhyphen{relative} \cpd{} \& \spv{} refers to the fact that \cpd{} \& \spv{} obtained from \sih{}, poled \& unpoled, annealed and as-deposited \pvdf{} thin films were compared to each other.\\
In the majority of experiments, the samples are introduced into the antechamber of a glovebox immediately after spinning to avoid oxidation and left there under reduced pressure for at least \SI{10}{\minute}, after which the antechamber was consecutively evacuated and refilled with pure \nitro{} three times to avoid contamination of the inert atmosphere. There was concern because oxygen-levels in the glovebox reached high values, so some of the experiments were carried out in ambient atmosphere until it became clear that the solvents and procedures of this project were not the cause of the contamination in the glovebox. The initial experiments with the high-voltage poling apparatus were carried out in ambient until a sufficiently empty glovebox was found to accommodate the bulk of the apparatus.\\
\subsubsection{\pvtr{} Nanoparticles}
The synthesis of \pvtr{} nanoparticles follows the procedure described by Xiao~\etal{}~\cite{NPsynthesis}. \pvtr{} is dissolved in acetone, a good solvent for the polymer, at a concentration of \SI{5}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} and a mixture of water and methanol of 1:10 by volume is prepared. These solutions and pure acetone are placed in ice and the solutions are allowed to cool down for five minutes. \SI{2}{\milli\litre} of the \pvtr{}-acetone solution are injected into a \SI{15}{\milli\litre} centrifuge tube. \SI{0.5}{\milli\litre} of pure acetone are carefully injected from the bottom to form a buffer layer and subsequently \SI{4}{\milli\litre} of the water:methanol blend are also carefully injected from the bottom. The centrifuge tube is handled carefully so as not to disturb the sensitive layers and placed in ice. The nanoparticles are then precipitated out by centrifuging at \SI{19500}{rpm} for ten minutes at \SI{2}{\degreeCelsius}. The bottom layer containing \nps{} is transferred to a flask via a micro porous filter and refluxed at \SI{90}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{60}{\minute}. The obtained solution contains \pvtr{} \nps{} and can be used for further experiments.\\
It was found that the time needed to transfer the prepared layers to the centrifuge should be minimised in order to obtain the smallest nanoparticle sizes from the synthesis, \ie{} the smallest particles were obtained when the transfer time was less than a minute, while a transfer time of $\sim$\SI{10}{\minute} resulted in particles with diameters on the orders for micro-meters.\\
Ultra-high centrifuge speeds were found to impact the narrowness of the size distribution to a small extend. Centrifuging at \SI{18000}{rpm} was sufficient to obtain a population with a narrow size distribution, but the nanoparticle size was unaccountably too high.\\
The synthesis was carried out toward the end of the project and the problem with it became apparent too late to order a different polymer preparation: the ratio of polymer to co-polymer available for this project was 70:30 and therefore, its Curie-temperature is above the boiling point of any water:methanol mixture and indeed the synthesis by Xiao~\etal{} makes use of a 50:50 polymer:co-polymer mixture. \enhyphen{Refluxing} under conditions of increased pressure proved fruitless and substituting the water:methanol mixture with pure water in an attempt to boil under pressure at elevated temperatures was not feasible experimentally, because acetone would mix with pure water and no stable interface layers would form. Therefore, even though \nps{} could be synthesised, the material did not crystallise in its ferroelectric phase and the \nps{} could not usefully be combined with solar cells. Possible further experimentation should use an appropriate polymer:copolymer mixture, \ie{} one in which $T_C$ is below the boiling point of the suspending liquid such as, for example, the one used by Xiao~\etal{}
\subsection{Contact Potential Difference and Surface Photovoltage}
Over the course of the entire project, \cpd{} and \spv{} remained the main tool to see whether attempts at poling \pvdf{} were successful or not, mainly because of the great experimental ease and expediency with which the experiments could be carried out. Not all individual experiments will be presented here, but a summary of the main findings will be given. It has to be mentioned from the outset that during the whole project, no effects of successful poling could be shown and that no systematic variation of either poling-direction, solvents used, annealing temperatures or poling field strength could be shown and that results obtained in the literature, \eg{} by Lui~\etal{}~\cite{liu_THEpaper}, could not be reproduced. It is assumed that treatment with \pvdf{} remained ineffective because while the $\beta$-phase could be obtained, dipole-ordering of the ferroelectric domains failed. This might well be because poling field strengths were just too low.  The literature suggests that this should not have been the case~\cite{ducharme_finitesize}, or at least that \pvdf{} thin films used throughout this project should present a borderline case which might not reach full polarisation at the field strengths employed here, but which should never the less have shown \emph{some} effect of polarisation.\\
The \cpd{} and \spv{} experiments always compared poled to unpoled \pvdf{} thin films to untreated \sih{}. The low-voltage poling set-up gave \cpd{} and \spv{} results that were completely irregular. Independent of the poling direction, the \cpd{} of the \enhyphen{poled} sample could be up to $\sim$\SI{300}{\milli\volt} higher or lower than that of the unpoled sample and bore no discernible connection to the untreated \sih{} surface, either. The conclusion was drawn that the contacting top-electrode in the \SI{18}{\volt} poling set-up might have been a source of unknown contamination, even though care was taken that it would only ever come in contact with \enhyphen{clean} \pvdf{} surfaces and was cleaned and/or replaced by a fresh electrode from time to time. For that reason, the switch to the non-contacting poling set-up was done, even if that set-up would provide lower poling field-strengths.\\
Initial experiments with the high-voltage, no-contact set-up showed similar variations as before. This was then ascribed to acetone being a poor solvent for creation of \pvdf{} thin films and a switch to \dmf{} solvent was made. With this set-up the \spv{} of samples with the ferroelectric polymer varied around that of untreated \sih{} to within experimental uncertainty: the \spv{} of \enhyphen{poled} and unpoled \pvdf{} samples was \SIrange{14}{32}{\milli\volt} compared to \SI{20+-10}{\milli\volt} for fresh \sih{} surfaces. The \cpd{} of the \pvdf{} samples was now systematically lower than that of untreated \sih{}, with a difference ranging from \SIrange{50}{250}{\milli\volt}, depending on the exact thin film deposition method. The greatest difference in \cpd{} between untreated reference and \pvdf{} samples was found when samples were annealed at \SI{135}{\degreeCelsius} for more than \SI{30}{\minute} and when they were subsequently quenched on ice prior to poling. The difference between \enhyphen{poled} and unpoled \pvdf{} surfaces never exceeded the experimental uncertainty and the direction of the difference could not be changed by reverse-poling, either. Therefore, a switch of solvents used for \pvdf{} was again made, from \dmf{} to cyclohexanone, based on clues found in the literature~\cite{naber_cyclo}. At the same time, it was realised that \pvdf{} films might be too thin for the employed poling field strengths to be effective, so \enhyphen{thicker} solutions of \pvdf{} were employed and the speed of the spin cast was reduced from \SI{4000}{rpm} to \SI{3000}{rpm} and poling was carried out at elevated temperatures below $T_C$.\\
With these measures, the \cpd{} of samples with a polymer top layer was \SI{230+-40}{\milli\volt} below that of untreated \sih{} and there was a \SI{15+-5}{\milli\volt} difference between the \enhyphen{poled} and unpoled \pvdf{} samples, which could be switched in direction by reverse poling in three experiments, but the effect could not always be reproduced. This is an unexpected result which can only be explained if it is assumed that \enhyphen{poling} failed during the entirety of this project and that the influence of \pvdf{} on the work function of the silicon substrate is not due to its macroscopic or microscopic ferroelectric field, but due to some chemical effect of the polymer on the silicon surface.
\subsection{Ellipsometry and Profilometry}
The ellipsometer is an FQTH-100 by J. A. Woodlam Co. It is calibrated with a silicon/silicon-oxide standard. The model is silicon of appropriate thickness (\SI{500}{\micro\metre} for most wafers) plus a Cauchy-layer with thickness set as a fitting parameter. The spectroscopic scan is done over \num{100} means. The profilometer is a Dektak 6M.
\subsubsection{\sih{}}
Five pieces of \sih{} n-type silicon (100) were prepared according to the standard procedure and the thickness of their surface layer was measured at three points per piece by ellipsometry. The thickness was \SI{7+-2}{\nano\metre}, which is consistent with clean, hydrogen passivated silicon. The same procedure was carried out for n-type silicon (111), hydrogen terminated by BOE, thickness \SI{10+-1}{\nano\metre}, and for n-type silicon (111), hydrogen terminated by NH$_4$F, thickness \SI{12+-1.5}{\nano\metre}. Where ever possible, n-type silicon (100)was preferred as a substrate because of these results.
\subsubsection{\pvdf{} Thin Films}
Three thin film samples each of \pvdf{} from solutions of \SI{1}{\percent} by weight in acetone and \dmf{}, spun \SI{500}{rpm} for \SI{5}{\second} and \SI{4000}{rpm} for \SI{40}{\second} and annealed at \SI{135}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{30}{\minute} were investigated by ellipsometry. Their thickness was \SI{17+-2}{\nano\metre} and \SI{20+-3}{\nano\metre} respectively. Solutions of \SIlist{1.3;2.5;5}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} \pvdf{} in cyclohexanone were likewise prepared and their thickness by ellipsometry was \SIlist{2.6+-0.1;4.6+-0.1;10.7+-0.2}{\nano\metre} respectively. Scratches were applied to the samples to reveal the underlying substrate and the height of the scratch was measured my profilometry. The measured thickness agreed to that found by ellipsometry to within \SI{3}{\nano\metre}.
\subsection{Lifetimes}
\subsubsection{\sih{}}
To assess the quality of the hydrogen passivation, carrier lifetimes in high quality n-type floatzone silicon were compared at different stages during the cleaning procedure. The minority carrier lifetimes in six individual pieces cut from the same wafer and lifetimes were measured \enhyphen{as -is}, \ie{} without any treatment just after cutting, after the first oxidation step and directly after the final chemical etch with HF. The results, summarised in Table \ref{tab:sihlifetimes}, show there are no systematic problems with the substrate preparation procedure, at least as far as minority carrier lifetimes are concerned. The variation in lifetimes after the final processing step is relatively higher than for the other stages, but is still sufficiently small so as to be no sign for concern about the quality of the passivating layer.
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Average minority carrier lifetimes and their standard deviations recorded from six individual pieces of n-type silicon at different stages during the cleaning procedure: 1) \enhyphen{as-is}, 2) after chemical rinsing and oxidation and 3) immediately after the final HF etch.}
\label{tab:sihlifetimes}
\input{./tabs/sihlifetimes}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{\pvdf{} Thin Films}
In a very similar experiment, the influence of \pvdf{} on the minority carrier lifetimes was investigated. The main interest was to compare poled and unpoled \pvdf{} to test the hypothesis that the electric field of the ferroelectric would reduce surface charge recombination. One piece of silicon was left untreated, \ie{} hydrogen passivated but was left on the hotplate alongside the pieces with a \pvdf{} top layer to account for possible effect of heating. This reference was also exposed to ambient for the same time that it took to spin cast \pvdf{} to account for oxidation. Finally, one piece of silicon was prepared with a surface layer of poly-methylmethacrylate (\pmma{}) to yield a sample with a comparable polymer surface layer. Four suitable pieces of silicon were cut, the two with the lowest carrier lifetimes were chosen for the untreated \sih{} reference and the \pmma{}. \sih{} was prepared according to the standard procedure, \pmma{} was spin cast onto a fresh \sih{} surface from a solution of \SI{0.3}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} \pmma{} in \thf{} at \SI{500}{rpm} for \SI{5}{\second} and \SI{4000}{rpm} for \SI{1}{\minute}. The sample was annealed on a separate hotplate inside the glovebox for \SI{10}{\minute} at \SI{80}{\degreeCelsius}. \pvdf{} thin films were spin cast onto fresh \sih{} from a solution of \SI{1}{\percent} by weight of \pvdf{} in acetone, spun at \SI{500}{rpm} for \SI{5}{\second} and \SI{4000}{rpm} for \SI{40}{\second}. \pvdf{} was annealed at \SI{130}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{10}{\minute} inside the glovebox. One sample was poled using the \SI{18}{\volt} setup over-night, one sample was left unpoled. Lifetimes were measured the next day. The minority carrier lifetime in the untreated sample had decayed to \SI{12.8}{\micro\second}, comparable to lifetimes measured in untreated Si-wafers that have a natural oxide layer. The lifetimes in the poled and unpoled \pvdf{} samples were virtually identical: \SI{9.22}{\micro\second} and \SI{9.3}{\micro\second} respectively. Lastly, the \pmma{} sample had a surprisingly high lifetime of \SI{67}{\micro\second}.\\
The conclusion has to be that poling \pvdf{} prepared in this way has no effect on minority carrier lifetime and that the presence of any \pvdf{} even degrades the surface carrier recombination rates. \pmma{} seemed to have shielded the underlying substrate from residual \oxy{} in the glovebox.\\
For lack of time, minority carrier lifetime experiments were not repeated with the insights gained from the \cpd{} experiments, \ie{} thicker layers of \pvdf{} prepared from cyclohexanone solution were not investigated for their lifetimes.

\subsection{Scanning Electron Microscopy}
\subsubsection{Influence of Solvent on Thin Film Morphology}
Thin films were spin cast on cleaned indium tinoxide (\ito{}) from \SI{5}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} \pvdf{} in cyclohexanone and from \SI{3}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} \pvdf{} in \dmf{}, compared in Figure \ref{fig:semsolvent}. Samples were annealed at \SI{135}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{30}{\minute} and the \pvdf{} was carefully scratched in some places to assure presence of polymer under the \sem{}. The substrate was placed inside a holder which electrically contacts both the substrate backside as well as the exposed \pvdf{} front surface and were introduced into a Field Emission \sem{} manufactured by JEOL, model JSF-7000F connected to and operated by the manufacturer's specific software. The acceleration voltage was \SI{5}{\kilo\volt} and the magnification was 25-times. The film morphology obtained from cyclohexanone, Figure \ref{fig:semCYCLO} is very homogeneous. The more conductive \ito{} surface appears darker in the image and serves as proof that polymer is indeed present in the image. Apart from the scratch, the coverage is complete. The individual bright spots are interpreted as dust particles from unusually long exposure to ambient. The scale-bar is invisible against the background of the sample, but is is the same as in Figure \ref{fig:semDMF}, as evidenced from the microscope's log-files. \dmf{} leads to rough, uneven \pvdf{} layers with speckles and folds, as can clearly be seen in Figure \ref{fig:semDMF}. The observations made here are in accordance with the literature~\cite{naber_cyclo}.

\subsubsection{Nanoparticle Characterisation}
Nanoparticle suspension was pipetted onto a cleaned \ito{} surface and the solvent was either allowed to evaporate naturally or in one case the sample was heated to annealing temperature (\SI{135}{\degreeCelsius}). The \ito{} substrates were introduced into the \sem{} in the same manner as the thin film samples. \sem{} was mainly used as a tool to determine the diameter of synthesised \nps{}. In total 23 individual \nps{} from four individual batches of synthesis were measured. The very first batch was discarded because the \enhyphen{nano}particles had an average size of $\sim$\SI{0.9}{\micro\metre}. This was because instead of directly precipitating by centrifuge, the layered solutions were left standing in the lab for $\sim$\SI{10}{\minute}. The results of the measurements of the subsequent batches are given in Table \ref{tab:npsize}. It is interesting to note that both the average size as well as the variation in the population decrease with increasing experimental experience~\footnote{The batches are numbered as successive syntheses,\ie{} b$_1$ was the first (not discarded) synthesis, b$_4$ the last that was investigated with \sem{}}. This is mainly due to faster processing of the individual synthesis steps and because later syntheses were carried out closer to the centrifuge to minimise the time the layers stay in contact without being centrifuged. The particles are about twice as big as those obtained by Xiao~\etal{}~\cite{NPsynthesis}, however, it is not immediately apparent from their paper if they used \np{} radius or \np{} diameter as a measure of size. It is assumed that diameter was used, just as in this project. Their population size distribution is narrower: standard deviation $\sim$\SI{12}{\nano\metre} compared to \SI{14}{\nano\metre} in this project's \enhyphen{best} synthesis. This may be because the centrifuging speeds for this project were instrumentally limited to \SI{18000}{rpm} instead of the prescribed \SI{20000}{rpm} or maybe because they measured \num{71} individual \nps{} instead of the five individual \nps{} in batch b$_4$.
\begin{table}

\label{tab:npsize}
\input{./tabs/npsize}
\end{table}
\sem{} was also used to try to establish the overall morphology of the \nps{}, see Figure \ref{fig:semnps} for an overview of encountered structures. Figure \ref{fig:semtypnano} shows a typical \sem{} image of the \nps{} synthesised in this project. Overall, they are roughly spherical, evenly distributed and show only few clusters. Some other \sem{} images did not show clusters at all. Lastly, it was mentioned that the \np{} dispersion could not be refluxed at a sufficiently high temperature to obtain the correct crystallographic phase. It was therefore attempted to \enhyphen{anneal} the \nps{} after being spun cast onto a substrate. The result is seen in Figure \ref{fig:semnanosoup}: unsurprisingly, the \nps{} melted and formed amorphous structures on the substrate.

\subsection{\dls{} and \np{} Size Distribution}
Dynamic light scattering measurements to characterise the size distribution of synthesised nanoparticles was carried out in a Zetasizer Nano ZSP, at room temperature. Because of its experimental ease and expediency, \dls{} was used to characterise nearly every single batch of synthesised \nps{}, until the experimental procedure was sufficiently practised to obtain \nps{} of reproducible size distributions. The nanoparticles could be taken directly from suspension and no further preparations were needed to measure \dls{}. The size distributions obtained from the Zetasizer usually showed more than one characteristic peak, but in all cases, \enhyphen{unrealistic} peaks could be identified and appropriate restrictions on the distributions as laid out in Section \ref{sec:dlstheo} could be found. Not all those individual characterisations will be shown, instead Figure~\ref{fig:dlsmeas} compares the population size distributions for \nps{} precipitated into pure water and that of \nps{} precipitated into a water:methanol mixture of 1:10 by volume. Normal distributions that characterise the nanoparticle size distributions were calculated from the histogram data. For the nanoparticles precipitated into the water:methanol blend, a size of \SI{164+-26}{\nano\metre} is obtained, while precipitation into pure water yielded \nps{} with a diameter of \SI{220+-54}{\nano\metre}. These observations are in line with those obtained from \sem{}: the \nps{} are about a factor $\sim$2 larger than what was expected from the literature, as is their size variance, but these factors may be explained by the limited centrifuging speeds available or by a misunderstanding of the definition of \enhyphen{size} employed by Xiao~\etal{}~\cite{NPsynthesis}.

\subsection{\ftir{} Spectra of \pvdf{} Thin Films and Nanoparticles}
\sisetup{per-mode = reciprocal-positive-first}
\ftir{} spectra were obtained using a ThermoScientific Nicolet 6700 FT-IR in \atr{} \ftir{} configuration. Thin films were spin cast from a solution \SI{50}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} \pvdf{} in cyclohexanone at \SI{500}{rpm} for \SI{5}{\second} and \SI{3000}{rpm} for \SI{55}{\second} and annealed at \SI{135}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{30}{\minute} in the glovebox. Poling was attemped using the \SI{18}{\volt} set-up for one hour, also in the glovebox. The reference was a freshly prepared \sih{} surface. Nanoparticles were taken from suspension by repeatedly applying solution to an oxidised silicon surface and allowing the liquid to evaporate naturally. The reference was an oxidised silicon surface. Reference \ftir{} spectra for $\beta$-phase \pvdf{}, poled and unpoled, can be found in the literature~\cite{liu_THEpaper}. The spectra are shown in Figure \ref{fig:irplot}. The transmittance value is arbitrary and the obtained spectra were shifted to be displayed well alongside each other and the positions of the characteristic peaks are indicated by dashed lines.\\

	\caption{\ftir{} spectra of \pvdf{} in different configurations. The positions for peaks characteristic of the ferroelectric $\beta$-phase are indicated by dashed lines.}
	\label{fig:irplot}
\end{figure}
The characteristic peaks at \SIlist{1279;1324}{\per\centi\metre} less well developed than what is expected from the literature, but the overall shape of the thin film spectra still indicates presence of the $\beta$-phase of \pvdf{}. The more pronounced peaks at \SIlist{1274;1288}{\per\centi\metre} in the poled thin film compared to the unpoled thin film and their ratio compared to the highest peak at $\sim$\SI{1190}{\per\centi\metre} may be taken as an indication of polarisation of the ferroelectric perpendicular to the substrate~\cite{mao_optim}. The nanoparticles do not show features typical for the $\beta$-phase of \pvdf{}, because they could not be refluxed at sufficiently high temperatures.

\label{fig:iv}
\end{figure}
Ferroelectrically assisted solar cells, \ie{} Schottky junctions, were created from a silicon substrate obtained via the standard procedure. \pvdf{} was spin cast at \SI{500}{rpm} for \SI{5}{\second} and \SI{3000}{rpm} for \SI{55}{\second} from a solution of \SI{1}{\milli\gram\per\milli\litre} \pvdf{} in cyclohexanone. \pvdf{} was annealed at \SI{138}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{30}{\minute} in the glovebox. A \pdot{} layer on top of the ferroelectric was spin cast for \SI{1}{\minute} at \SI{1000}{rpm} from a solution of \SI{6}{\milli\litre} \pdot{} stock with \SI{0.057}{\gram} ethyldiglycol (\edg{}) and \SI{0.004}{\gram} of Zonyl surfactant in \SI{2}{\milli\litre} water. \pdot{} was annealed \SI{140}{\degreeCelsius} for \SI{30}{\minute} in the glovebox. Top electrodes were thermally evaporated from high purity Ag at a rate of \SI{2}{\angstrom\per\second} for \SI{100}{\second} at manual settings. The back contact of the junction was created by scratching with a diamond tip and applying InGa eutectic. Polymer was scratched off the substrate to obtain a rectangular active area, the size of which was determined with optical microscopy. Poling was attempted via the solar cells top and bottom electrodes using two series-connected \SI{9}{\volt} batteries. In the first experiment, four cells were characterised with IV immediately after evaporation. Because of experimental and time limitations, the \enhyphen{best} cell was chosen and left over-night. The next day, it was characterised by IV to gain a measure for its degradation in the glovebox over night. The cell was then poled for \SI{1}{\hour} and was characterised by IV, reverse-poled for \SI{1}{\hour} and characterised again. Poling was done in ambient. The IV curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:iv1}. Th cell degraded in ambient and lost its rectifying characteristics, currents decreased by a factor $\sim$40.\\
The same experiment was repeated, but cell-processing, characterisation, poling and reverse poling were all carried out in one day and exposure of the cells to air was minimised by poling \& reverse poling inside the glovebox. Defining \& measuring the cell area, creating a back contact and characterisation still exposed the cells to ambient. The IV curves are shown in Figure \ref{fig:iv2}. The poling procedures reduced the cell current by a factor $\sim$90.\\
The reason the cells degraded to such an extend is obvious in hindsight. The poling procedure exposed the cells to a positive bias of \SI{18}{\volt} and the batteries and cell were connected in series to the back- and front contacts of the cell. A constant current of relative high magnitude was therefore lead through the cells for an hour. Care should have been taken to limit the degrading currents through the cell. It is surprising that the \enhyphen{poled} cells in the second experiment still show any rectifying behaviour at all and that the poling direction still influenced the current through the cells. An influence of the ferroelectric properties of \pvdf{} on the behaviour of inversion-layer solar cells could therefore be shown to a minute extend, but the effect could not be used to achieve the goal of this project, namely to \emph{enhance} solar cells.  

\newpage
\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
Two critical sources for the understanding of this project, the \enhyphen{Encyclopedia of Smart Materials}~\cite{encyclopedia} and the finite size effect of on the polarisation of \pvdf{} layers~\cite{ducharme_finitesize}, were not known during the time of the actual project. Several experimental mistakes could have been avoided had that been the case. The approach of first preparing a thin film of \pvdf{} and measuring its effect on the underlying substrate proved largely fruitless. The idea was to study a simpler system first, before going on to assemble complete cells. From the available literature about cells that incorporate \pvdf{}, the conclusion was drawn, that thin films $<$\SI{20}{\nano\metre} should be investigated, but \pvdf{} films in solar cell applications are size limited because of their insulating character. Thicker films might have proven more useful for identifying an effect on the work function of the substrate, especially given the limitations imposed by the finite size effect and the available poling field strengths. The simpler poling set up making use of a contacting electrode probably suffered from contaminations, while the contact-less high voltage set up did not provide a sufficiently strong field to appreciably pole the ferroelectric. For the characterisation with \ftir{}, thicker films were employed to gain a measurable signal and poling was attempted with the contacting set up. Accordingly, some evidence of poled \pvdf{} films could be found in the \ftir{} spectra. Cyclohexanone was identified as the best solvent for obtaining homogeneous \pvdf{} thin film layers, in accordance with the literature~\cite{naber_cyclo}. Once fully assembled, a c-\sih{}/\pvdf{}/\pdot{} Schottky junction solar cell showed an effect of poling the ferroelectric. Cells could not be improved because they were subjected to high currents as a result of high positive bias for extended periods of time. This mistake is obvious in hindsight, but was not realised at the time. The \pvdf{} films employed in the cells were exceedingly thin, $\sim$\SI{1}{\nano\metre}, but poling via the front and back contacts of the cell yielded a sufficiently strong electrical field to overcome the finite size effect and induce a measurable polarisation in the films non the less.\\
Nanoparticles were synthesised from the material and characterised. They did not crystallise in the ferroelectric $\beta$-phase, because $T_C$ of the material used here was too high to allow \enhyphen{refluxing} at the necessary temperatures. This experimental oversight only became clear during an eMail a correspondence with one of the authors of the original paper by Xiao~\etal{}.\\
Future research should learn from the avoidable mistakes made here and should concentrate on the correct methods for the correct aims: if \pvdf{}'s influence on the work function is to be studied, sufficiently thick films should be employed. If the goal is to enhance solar cells, complete junctions should be assembled right away, because they provide a convenient way of poling the ferroelectric via their contacts that avoids contamination of the thin films. If contact-less poling is attempted, a method will have to be found that would allow placing the top electrode at heights above the sample in the micro-meter range. The set up used here was incapable of such precise placing and the electrical breakdown of air accordingly placed limitations on poling field strengths, ultimately rendering the set up useless for our purposes. Instead of trying to reproduce every literature result step by step using simple and successively more complex systems, the characteristics of \pvdf{} should be understood as well documented and well established by at least a whole generation of researchers. Some of those results were reproduced in this project, but because of the failures along the way, the research could not be carried on to the point of adding to the existing knowledge.
